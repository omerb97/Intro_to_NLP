<bos> to the people of the state of new york,O O O O O O O O O :
<bos> the last paper having concluded the observations which were meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by the convention we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the first question that offers itself is whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican it is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of america with the fundamental principles of the revolution or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government if the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> what then are the distinctive characters of the republican form were an answer to this question to be sought not by recurring to principles but in the application of the term by political writers to the constitution of different states no satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified with the same appellation the government of england which has one republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political disquisitions,"O , , O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O . , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established we may define a republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure for a limited period or during good behavior it is essential to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient for such a government that the persons administering it be appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified otherwise every government in the united states as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican character according to the constitution of every state in the union some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode of appointment is extended to one of the co-ordinate branches of the legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a definite period and in many instances both within the legislative and executive departments to a period of years according to the provisions of most of the constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behavior,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O .

<bos> on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly derived from the choice of the people according to the example in most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the union will as in the several states be the choice though a remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of two years as in the state of south carolina the senate is elective for the period of six years which is but one year more than the period of the senate of maryland and but two more than that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in south carolina for two years in the other states the election is annual in several of the states however no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office the president of the united states is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of the case and the example of the state constitutions,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the state governments and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the latter,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> `` but it was not sufficient '' say the adversaries of the proposed constitution `` for the convention to adhere to the republican form they ought with equal care to have preserved the federal form which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign states instead of which they have framed a national government which regards the union as a consolidation of the states '' and it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken the handle which has been made of this objection requires that it should be examined with some precision,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the objection is founded it will be necessary to a just estimate of its force first to ascertain the real character of the government in question secondly to inquire how far the convention were authorized to propose such a government and thirdly how far the duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> first in order to ascertain the real character of the government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be established to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of those powers to the extent of them and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced,"O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> on examining the first relation it appears on one hand that the constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of america given by deputies elected for the special purpose but on the other that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire nation but as composing the distinct and independent states to which they respectively belong it is to be the assent and ratification of the several states derived from the supreme authority in each state the authority of the people themselves the act therefore establishing the constitution will not be a national but a federal act,"O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O , , O O , O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> that it will be a federal and not a national act as these terms are understood by the objectors the act of the people as forming so many independent states not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this single consideration that it is to result neither from the decision of a majority of the people of the union nor from that of a majority of the states it must result from the unanimous assent of the several states that are parties to it differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed not by the legislative authority but by that of the people themselves were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation the will of the majority of the whole people of the united states would bind the minority in the same manner as the majority in each state must bind the minority and the will of the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual votes or by considering the will of the majority of the states as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the united states neither of these rules have been adopted each state in ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary act in this relation then the new constitution will if established be a federal and not a national constitution,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived the house of representatives will derive its powers from the people of america and the people will be represented in the same proportion and on the same principle as they are in the legislature of a particular state so far the government is national not federal the senate on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal societies and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the senate as they now are in the existing congress so far the government is federal not national the executive power will be derived from a very compound source the immediate election of the president is to be made by the states in their political characters the votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio which considers them partly as distinct and coequal societies partly as unequal members of the same society the eventual election again is to be made by that branch of the legislature which consists of the national representatives but in this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from so many distinct and coequal bodies politic from this aspect of the government it appears to be of a mixed character presenting at least as many federal as national features,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O . O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O .

O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the difference between a federal and national government as it relates to the operation of the government is supposed to consist in this that in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing the confederacy in their political capacities in the latter on the individual citizens composing the nation in their individual capacities on trying the constitution by this criterion it falls under the national not the federal character though perhaps not so completely as has been understood in several cases and particularly in the trial of controversies to which states may be parties they must be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political capacities only so far the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features but this blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan and the operation of the government on the people in their individual capacities in its ordinary and most essential proceedings may on the whole designate it in this relation a national government,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O , O O O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , , O O , O , O O , O O ."
<bos> but if the government be national with regard to the operation of its powers it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers the idea of a national government involves in it not only an authority over the individual citizens but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things so far as they are objects of lawful government among a people consolidated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature among communities united for particular purposes it is vested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures in the former case all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme and may be controlled directed or abolished by it at pleasure in the latter the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy no more subject within their respective spheres to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them within its own sphere in this relation then the proposed government can not be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects it is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be established under the general government but this does not change the principle of the case the decision is to be impartially made according to the rules of the constitution and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact and that it ought to be established under the general rather than under the local governments or to speak more properly that it could be safely established under the first alone is a position not likely to be combated,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O , , O O O O O .

<bos> if we try the constitution by its last relation to the authority by which amendments are to be made we find it neither wholly national nor wholly federal were it wholly national the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the majority of the people of the union and this authority would be competent at all times like that of a majority of every national society to alter or abolish its established government were it wholly federal on the other hand the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all the mode provided by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these principles in requiring more than a majority and principles in requiring more than a majority and particularly in computing the proportion by states not by citizens it departs from the national and advances towards the federal character in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient it loses again the federal and partakes of the national character,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O .

<bos> the proposed constitution therefore is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both in its foundation it is federal not national in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn it is partly federal and partly national in the operation of these powers it is national not federal in the extent of them again it is federal not national and finally in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments it is neither wholly federal nor wholly national,"O O O , , , O , O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> the second point to be examined is whether the convention were authorized to frame and propose this mixed constitution the powers of the convention ought in strictness to be determined by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their respective constituents as all of these however had reference either to the recommendation from the meeting at annapolis in september 1786 or to that from congress in february 1787 it will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts the act from annapolis recommends the `` appointment of commissioners to take into consideration the situation of the united states to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union and to report such an act for that purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state will effectually provide for the same `` the recommendatory act of congress is in the words following,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , , O , O O O O O O O O , O , , O O O O , O , , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` whereas there is provision in the articles of confederation and perpetual union for making alterations therein by the assent of a congress of the united states and of the legislatures of the several states and whereas experience hath evinced that there are defects in the present confederation as a mean to remedy which several of the states and particularly the state of new york by express instructions to their delegates in congress have suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these states a firm national government,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O :"
<bos> `` resolved that in the opinion of congress it is expedient that on the second monday of may next a convention of delegates who shall have been appointed by the several states be held at philadelphia for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and reporting to congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in congress and confirmed by the states render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union,"O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> `` from these two acts it appears 1st that the object of the convention was to establish in these states a firm national government 2d that this government was to be such as would be adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union 3d that these purposes were to be effected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation as it is expressed in the act of congress or by such further provisions as should appear necessary as it stands in the recommendatory act from annapolis 4th that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to congress and to the states in order to be agreed to by the former and confirmed by the latter from a comparison and fair construction of these several modes of expression is to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted they were to frame a national government adequate to the exigencies of government and of the union and to reduce the articles of confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes,"O O O O O , O , , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there are two rules of construction dictated by plain reason as well as founded on legal axioms the one is that every part of the expression ought if possible to be allowed some meaning and be made to conspire to some common end the other is that where the several parts can not be made to coincide the less important should give way to the more important part the means should be sacrificed to the end rather than the end to the means,"O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O , O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> suppose then that the expressions defining the authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with each other that a national and adequate government could not possibly in the judgment of the convention be affected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation which part of the definition ought to have been embraced and which rejected which was the more important which the less important part which the end which the means let the most scrupulous expositors of delegated powers let the most inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention answer these questions let them declare whether it was of most importance to the happiness of the people of america that the articles of confederation should be disregarded and an adequate government be provided and the union preserved or that an adequate government should be omitted and the articles of confederation preserved let them declare whether the preservation of these articles was the end for securing which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means or whether the establishment of a government adequate to the national happiness was the end at which these articles themselves originally aimed and to which they ought as insufficient means to have been sacrificed,"O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O ?

<bos> but is it necessary to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable to each other that no alterations or provisions in the articles of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national and adequate government into such a government as has been proposed by the convention no stress it is presumed will in this case be laid on the title a change of that could never be deemed an exercise of ungranted power alterations in the body of the instrument are expressly authorized new provisions therein are also expressly authorized here then is a power to change the title to insert new articles to alter old ones must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed so long as a part of the old articles remain those who maintain the affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations between that degree of change which lies within the compass of alterations and further provisions and that which amounts to a transmutation of the government will it be said that the alterations ought not to have touched the substance of the confederation the states would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity nor described its objects with so much latitude if some substantial reform had not been in contemplation will it be said that the fundamental principles of the confederation were not within the purview of the convention and ought not to have been varied i ask what are these principles do they require that in the establishment of the constitution the states should be regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns they are so regarded by the constitution proposed,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> do they require that the members of the government should derive their appointment from the legislatures not from the people of the states one branch of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures and under the confederation the delegates to congress may all be appointed immediately by the people and in two states1 are actually so appointed do they require that the powers of the government should act on the states and not immediately on individuals in some instances as has been shown the powers of the new government will act on the states in their collective characters in some instances also those of the existing government act immediately on individuals in cases of capture of piracy of the post office of coins weights and measures of trade with the indians of claims under grants of land by different states and above all in the case of trials by courts-marshal in the army and navy by which death may be inflicted without the intervention of a jury or even of a civil magistrate in all these cases the powers of the confederation operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual citizens,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ?

<bos> do these fundamental principles require particularly that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of the states the confederation itself authorizes a direct tax to a certain extent on the post office the power of coinage has been so construed by congress as to levy a tribute immediately from that source also but pretermitting these instances was it not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal expectation of the people that the regulation of trade should be submitted to the general government in such a form as would render it an immediate source of general revenue had not congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the confederation had not every state but one had not new york herself so far complied with the plan of congress as to recognize the principle of the innovation do these principles in fine require that the powers of the general government should be limited and that beyond this limit the states should be left in possession of their sovereignty and independence we have seen that in the new government as in the old the general powers are limited and that the states in all unenumerated cases are left in the enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> the truth is that the great principles of the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of confederation the misfortune under the latter system has been that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the aspect of an entire transformation of the old in one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their commission instead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation of the legislatures of all the states they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed by the people and may be carried into effect by nine states only it is worthy of remark that this objection though the most plausible has been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed against the convention the forbearance can only have proceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting the fate of twelve states to the perverseness or corruption of a thirteenth from the example of inflexible opposition given by a majority of one sixtieth of the people of america to a measure approved and called for by the voice of twelve states comprising fifty-nine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and prosperity of his country as this objection therefore has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without further observation,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the third point to be inquired into is how far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could have supplied any defect of regular authority in the preceding inquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and tried with the same rigor and by the same rules as if they had been real and final powers for the establishment of a constitution for the united states we have seen in what manner they have borne the trial even on that supposition it is time now to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and recommendatory that they were so meant by the states and so understood by the convention and that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a constitution which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is addressed this reflection places the subject in a point of view altogether different and will enable us to judge with propriety of the course taken by the convention let us view the ground on which the convention stood,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may be collected from their proceedings that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with the crisis which had led their country almost with one voice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced that they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of their appointment it could not be unknown to them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of citizens throughout this great empire were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations they had every reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the liberty and prosperity of the united states,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> they had seen in the origin and progress of the experiment the alacrity with which the proposition made by a single state virginia towards a partial amendment of the confederation had been attended to and promoted they had seen the liberty assumed by a very few deputies from a very few states convened at annapolis of recommending a great and critical object wholly foreign to their commission not only justified by the public opinion but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen states they had seen in a variety of instances assumptions by congress not only of recommendatory but of operative powers warranted in the public estimation by occasions and objects infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O ( ) O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O , O O , O O O , O O , , , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> they must have reflected that in all great changes of established governments forms ought to give way to substance that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former would render nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people to `` abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness '' 2 since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some informal and unauthorized propositions made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens,"O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> they must have recollected that it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the people plans for their safety and happiness that the states were first united against the danger with which they were threatened by their ancient government that committees and congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and defending their rights and that conventions were elected in the several states for establishing the constitutions under which they are now governed nor could it have been forgotten that no little ill-timed scruples no zeal for adhering to ordinary forms were anywhere seen except in those who wished to indulge under these masks their secret enmity to the substance contended for they must have borne in mind that as the plan to be framed and proposed was to be submitted to the people themselves the disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever its approbation blot out antecedent errors and irregularities it might even have occurred to them that where a disposition to cavil prevailed their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them and still more their recommendation of any measure whatever not warranted by their commission would not less excite animadversion than a recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the national exigencies,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> had the convention under all these impressions and in the midst of all these considerations instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country by whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished and of pointing out a system capable in their judgment of securing its happiness taken the cold and sullen resolution of disappointing its ardent hopes of sacrificing substance to forms of committing the dearest interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events let me ask the man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception who can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion what judgment ought to have been pronounced by the impartia,"O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O"

<bos> or if there be a man whose propensity to condemn is susceptible of no control let me then ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve states who usurped the power of sending deputies to the convention a body utterly unknown to their constitutions for congress who recommended the appointment of this body equally unknown to the confederation and for the state of new york in particular which first urged and then complied with this unauthorized interposition,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> but that the objectors may be disarmed of every pretext it shall be granted for a moment that the convention were neither authorized by their commission nor justified by circumstances in proposing a constitution for their country does it follow that the constitution ought for that reason alone to be rejected if according to the noble precept it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy shall we set the ignoble example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our friends,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O , O O O , O O ? , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> the prudent inquiry in all cases ought surely to be not so much from whom the advice comes as whether the advice be good the sum of what has been here advanced and proved is that the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers except in one instance little urged by the objectors has no foundation to support it that if they had exceeded their powers they were not only warranted but required as the confidential servants of their country by the circumstances in which they were placed to exercise the liberty which they assume and that finally if they had violated both their powers and their obligations in proposing a constitution this ought nevertheless to be embraced if it be calculated to accomplish the views and happiness of the people of america how far this character is due to the constitution is the subject under investigation,"O O O , O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> it is not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient history in which government has been established with deliberation and consent the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly of men but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> minos we learn was the primitive founder of the government of crete as zaleucus was of that of the locrians theseus first and after him draco and solon instituted the government of athens lycurgus was the lawgiver of sparta the foundation of the original government of rome was laid by romulus and the work completed by two of his elective successors numa and tullius hostilius on the abolition of royalty the consular administration was substituted by brutus who stepped forward with a project for such a reform which he alleged had been prepared by tullius hostilius and to which his address obtained the assent and ratification of the senate and people this remark is applicable to confederate governments also amphictyon we are told was the author of that which bore his name the achaean league received its first birth from achaeus and its second from aratus,"O , O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> what degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in their respective establishments or how far they might be clothed with the legitimate authority of the people can not in every instance be ascertained in some however the proceeding was strictly regular draco appears to have been intrusted by the people of athens with indefinite powers to reform its government and laws and solon according to plutarch was in a manner compelled by the universal suffrage of his fellow-citizens to take upon him the sole and absolute power of new-modeling the constitution the proceedings under lycurgus were less regular but as far as the advocates for a regular reform could prevail they all turned their eyes towards the single efforts of that celebrated patriot and sage instead of seeking to bring about a revolution by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> whence could it have proceeded that a people jealous as the greeks were of their liberty should so far abandon the rules of caution as to place their destiny in the hands of a single citizen whence could it have proceeded that the athenians a people who would not suffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than the illustrious merit of a fellow-citizen should consider one illustrious citizen as a more eligible depositary of the fortunes of themselves and their posterity than a select body of citizens from whose common deliberations more wisdom as well as more safety might have been expected these questions can not be fully answered without supposing that the fears of discord and disunion among a number of counsellors exceeded the apprehension of treachery or incapacity in a single individual history informs us likewise of the difficulties with which these celebrated reformers had to contend as well as the expedients which they were obliged to employ in order to carry their reforms into effect solon who seems to have indulged a more temporizing policy confessed that he had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their happiness but most tolerable to their prejudices and lycurgus more true to his object was under the necessity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of superstition and of securing his final success by a voluntary renunciation first of his country and then of his life if these lessons teach us on one hand to admire the improvement made by america on the ancient mode of preparing and establishing regular plans of government they serve not less on the other to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident to such experiments and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily multiplying them,"O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> is it an unreasonable conjecture that the errors which may be contained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and difficult subject than from a want of accuracy or care in the investigation of it and consequently such as will not be ascertained until an actual trial shall have pointed them out this conjecture is rendered probable not only by many considerations of a general nature but by the particular case of the articles of confederation it is observable that among the numerous objections and amendments suggested by the several states when these articles were submitted for their ratification not one is found which alludes to the great and radical error which on actual trial has discovered itself and if we except the observations which new jersey was led to make rather by her local situation than by her peculiar foresight it may be questioned whether a single suggestion was of sufficient moment to justify a revision of the system there is abundant reason nevertheless to suppose that immaterial as these objections were they would have been adhered to with a very dangerous inflexibility in some states had not a zeal for their opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful sentiment of selfpreservation one state we may remember persisted for several years in refusing her concurrence although the enemy remained the whole period at our gates or rather in the very bowels of our country nor was her pliancy in the end effected by a less motive than the fear of being chargeable with protracting the public calamities and endangering the event of the contest every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these important facts,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> a patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse and that an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger after coolly revolving his situation and the characters of different physicians selects and calls in such of them as he judges most capable of administering relief and best entitled to his confidence the physicians attend the case of the patient is carefully examined a consultation is held they are unanimously agreed that the symptoms are critical but that the case with proper and timely relief is so far from being desperate that it may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution they are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy by which this happy effect is to be produced the prescription is no sooner made known however than a number of persons interpose and without denying the reality or danger of the disorder assure the patient that the prescription will be poison to his constitution and forbid him under pain of certain death to make use of it might not the patient reasonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on some other remedy to be substituted and if he found them differing as much from one another as from his first counsellors would he not act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy nor agree in proposing one,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> such a patient and in such a situation is america at this moment she has been sensible of her malady she has obtained a regular and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice and she is warned by others against following this advice under pain of the most fatal consequences do the monitors deny the reality of her danger no do they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful remedy no are they agreed are any two of them agreed in their objections to the remedy proposed or in the proper one to be substituted let them speak for themselves this one tells us that the proposed constitution ought to be rejected because it is not a confederation of the states but a government over individuals another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to a certain extent but by no means to the extent proposed a third does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent proposed but to the want of a bill of rights a fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights of individuals but of the rights reserved to the states in their political capacity a fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be superfluous and misplaced and that the plan would be unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and places of election an objector in a large state exclaims loudly against the unreasonable equality of representation in the senate an objector in a small state is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the house of representatives from this quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expense from the number of persons who are to administer the new government from another quarter and sometimes from the same quarter on another occasion the cry is that the congress will be but a shadow of a representation and that the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled a patriot in a state that does not import or export discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct taxation the patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and imports is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may be thrown on consumption this politician discovers in the constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy that is equally sure it will end in aristocracy another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume but sees clearly it must be one or other of them whilst a fourth is not wanting who with no less confidence affirms that the constitution is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers that the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite propensities with another class of adversaries to the constitution the language is that the legislative executive and judiciary departments are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty whilst this objection circulates in vague and general expressions there are but a few who lend their sanction to it let each one come forward with his particular explanation and scarce any two are exactly agreed upon the subject in the eyes of one the junction of the senate with the president in the responsible function of appointing to offices instead of vesting this executive power in the executive alone is the vicious part of the organization to another the exclusion of the house of representatives whose numbers alone could be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power is equally obnoxious with another the admission of the president into any share of a power which ever must be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy no part of the arrangement according to some is more inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the senate which is alternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments when this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department `` we concur fully '' reply others `` in the objection to this part of the plan but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error our principal dislike to the organization arises from the extensive powers already lodged in that department '' even among the zealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted the demand of one gentleman is that the council should consist of a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the legislature another would prefer a larger number and considers it as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by the president himself,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the federal constitution let us suppose that as they are the most zealous so they are also the most sagacious of those who think the late convention were unequal to the task assigned them and that a wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted let us further suppose that their country should concur both in this favorable opinion of their merits and in their unfavorable opinion of the convention and should accordingly proceed to form them into a second convention with full powers and for the express purpose of revising and remoulding the work of the first were the experiment to be seriously made though it required some effort to view it seriously even in fiction i leave it to be decided by the sample of opinions just exhibited whether with all their enmity to their predecessors they would in any one point depart so widely from their example as in the discord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations and whether the constitution now before the public would not stand as fair a chance for immortality as lycurgus gave to that of sparta by making its change to depend on his own return from exile and death if it were to be immediately adopted and were to continue in force not until a better but until another should be agreed upon by this new assembly of lawgivers,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is a matter both of wonder and regret that those who raise so many objections against the new constitution should never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it it is not necessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that the latter is more imperfect no man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold because the latter had some alloy in it no man would refuse to quit a shattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious building because the latter had not a porch to it or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller or the ceilings a little higher or lower than his fancy would have planned them but waiving illustrations of this sort is it not manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new system lie with tenfold weight against the existing confederation is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the federal government the present congress can make requisitions to any amount they please and the states are constitutionally bound to furnish them they can emit bills of credit as long as they will pay for the paper they can borrow both abroad and at home as long as a shilling will be lent is an indefinite power to raise troops dangerous the confederation gives to congress that power also and they have already begun to make use of it is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men congress a single body of men are the sole depositary of all the federal powers is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury and the command of the army into the same hands the confederation places them both in the hands of congress is a bill of rights essential to liberty the confederation has no bill of rights is it an objection against the new constitution that it empowers the senate with the concurrence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the laws of the land the existing congress without any such control can make treaties which they themselves have declared and most of the states have recognized to be the supreme law of the land is the importation of slaves permitted by the new constitution for twenty years by the old it is permitted forever,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i shall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory it is rendered harmless by the dependence of congress on the state for the means of carrying them into practice that however large the mass of powers may be it is in fact a lifeless mass then say i in the first place that the confederation is chargeable with the still greater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to be absolutely necessary and at the same time rendering them absolutely nugatory and in the next place that if the union is to continue and no better government be substituted effective powers must either be granted to or assumed by the existing congress in either of which events the contrast just stated will hold good but this is not all out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government of the union it is now no longer a point of speculation and hope that the western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the united states and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses or for some time to come to yield any regular supplies for the public expenses yet must it hereafter be able under proper management both to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt and to furnish for a certain period liberal tributes to the federal treasury a very large proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual states and it may with reason be expected that the remaining states will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their equity and generosity we may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the united states will soon become a national stock congress have assumed the administration of this stock they have begun to render it productive congress have undertaken to do more they have proceeded to form new states to erect temporary governments to appoint officers for them and to prescribe the conditions on which such states shall be admitted into the confederacy all this has been done and done without the least color of constitutional authority yet no blame has been whispered no alarm has been sounded a great and independent fund of revenue is passing into the hands of a single body of men who can raise troops to an indefinite number and appropriate money to their support for an indefinite period of time and yet there are men who have not only been silent spectators of this prospect but who are advocates for the system which exhibits it and at the same time urge against the new system the objections which we have heard would they not act with more consistency in urging the establishment of the latter as no less necessary to guard the union against the future powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing congress than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present impotency of that assembly,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O , O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> i mean not by any thing here said to throw censure on the measures which have been pursued by congress i am sensible they could not have done otherwise the public interest the necessity of the case imposed upon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits but is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular powers commensurate to its objects a dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed,"O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two general points of view the first relates to the sum or quantity of power which it vests in the government including the restraints imposed on the states the second to the particular structure of the government and the distribution of this power among its several branches,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> under the first view of the subject two important questions arise,"O O O O O O O , O O O :"
<bos> this method of handling the subject can not impose on the good sense of the people of america it may display the subtlety of the writer it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation it may inflame the passions of the unthinking and may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking but cool and candid people will at once reflect that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them that the choice must always be made if not of the lesser evil at least of the greater not the perfect good and that in every political institution a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and abused they will see therefore that in all cases where power is to be conferred the point first to be decided is whether such a power be necessary to the public good as the next will be in case of an affirmative decision to guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> that we may form a correct judgment on this subject it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the government of the union and that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following different objects,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O :"
<bos> the powers falling within the first class are those of declaring war and granting letters of marque of providing armies and fleets of regulating and calling forth the militia of levying and borrowing money security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society it is an avowed and essential object of the american union the powers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the federal councils is the power of declaring war necessary no man will answer this question in the negative it would be superfluous therefore to enter into a proof of the affirmative the existing confederation establishes this power in the most ample form is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets necessary this is involved in the foregoing power it is involved in the power of self-defense but was it necessary to give an indefinite power of raising troops as well as providing fleets and of maintaining both in peace as well as in war the answer to these questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit an extensive discussion of them in this place the answer indeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any place with what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who can not limit the force of offense if a federal constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own government and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O .

<bos> how could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited unless we could prohibit in like manner the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation the means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack they will in fact be ever determined by these rules and by no others it is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation it is worse than in vain because it plants in the constitution itself necessary usurpations of power every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions if one nation maintains constantly a disciplined army ready for the service of ambition or revenge it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O ?

<bos> the fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the time of peace they were introduced by charles vii of france all europe has followed or been forced into the example had the example not been followed by other nations all europe must long ago have worn the chains of a universal monarch were every nation except france now to disband its peace establishments the same event might follow the veteran legions of rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world not the less true is it that the liberties of rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs and that the liberties of europe as far as they ever existed have with few exceptions been the price of her military establishments a standing force therefore is a dangerous at the same time that it may be a necessary provision on the smallest scale it has its inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a wise nation will combine all these considerations and whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties the clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed constitution the union itself which it cements and secures destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous america united with a handful of troops or without a single soldier exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than america disunited with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat,"O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it was remarked on a former occasion that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in europe being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors the rulers of great britain have never been able by real or artificial dangers to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment the distance of the united states from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy security a dangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible so long as they continue a united people but let it never for a moment be forgotten that they are indebted for this advantage to the union alone the moment of its dissolution will be the date of a new order of things the fears of the weaker or the ambition of the stronger states or confederacies will set the same example in the new as charles vii did in the old world the example will be followed here from the same motives which produced universal imitation there instead of deriving from our situation the precious advantage which great britain has derived from hers the face of america will be but a copy of that of the continent of europe it will present liberty everywhere crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes,"O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the fortunes of disunited america will be even more disastrous than those of europe the sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits no superior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations inflame their mutual animosities and render them the instruments of foreign ambition jealousy and revenge in america the miseries springing from her internal jealousies contentions and wars would form a part only of her lot a plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that relation in which europe stands to this quarter of the earth and which no other quarter of the earth bears to europe this picture of the consequences of disunion can not be too highly colored or too often exhibited every man who loves peace every man who loves his country every man who loves liberty ought to have it ever before his eyes that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the union of america and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> next to the effectual establishment of the union the best possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their support this precaution the constitution has prudently added i will not repeat here the observations which i flatter myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory light but it may not be improper to take notice of an argument against this part of the constitution which has been drawn from the policy and practice of great britain it is said that the continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of the legislature whereas the american constitution has lengthened this critical period to two years this is the form in which the comparison is usually stated to the public but is it a just form is it a fair comparison does the british constitution restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year does the american impose on the congress appropriations for two years on the contrary it can not be unknown to the authors of the fallacy themselves that the british constitution fixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature and that the american ties down the legislature to two years as the longest admissible term,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> had the argument from the british example been truly stated it would have stood thus the term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army establishment though unlimited by the british constitution has nevertheless in practice been limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year now if in great britain where the house of commons is elected for seven years where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the people where the electors are so corrupted by the representatives and the representatives so corrupted by the crown the representative body can possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term without desiring or without daring to extend the term beyond a single year ought not suspicion herself to blush in pretending that the representatives of the united states elected freely by the whole body of the people every second year can not be safely intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations expressly limited to the short period of two years a bad cause seldom fails to betray itself of this truth the management of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O . , O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> but among all the blunders which have been committed none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people of standing armies the attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important subject and has led to investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal conviction not only that the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against danger from that quarter but that nothing short of a constitution fully adequate to the national defense and the preservation of the union can save america from as many standing armies as it may be split into states or confederacies and from such a progressive augmentation of these establishments in each as will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people as any establishment that can become necessary under a united and efficient government must be tolerable to the former and safe to the latter,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> the palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution against a spirit of censure which has spared few other parts it must indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of america that as her union will be the only source of her maritime strength so this will be a principal source of her security against danger from abroad in this respect our situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of great britain the batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our safety are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government against our liberties,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the inhabitants of the atlantic frontier are all of them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection and if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds if their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious adventurers if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden invaders these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom it claims allegiance but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> if we except perhaps virginia and maryland which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern frontiers no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this subject than new york her seacoast is extensive a very important district of the state is an island the state itself is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues the great emporium of its commerce the great reservoir of its wealth lies every moment at the mercy of events and may almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians should a war be the result of the precarious situation of european affairs and all the unruly passions attending it be let loose on the ocean our escape from insults and depredations not only on that element but every part of the other bordering on it will be truly miraculous,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the present condition of america the states more immediately exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exists and if their single resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against the danger the object to be protected would be almost consumed by the means of protecting them the power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently vindicated and explained the power of levying and borrowing money being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the national defense is properly thrown into the same class with it this power also has been examined already with much attention and has i trust been clearly shown to be necessary both in the extent and form given to it by the constitution,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i will address one additional reflection only to those who contend that the power ought to have been restrained to external taxation by which they mean taxes on articles imported from other countries it can not be doubted that this will always be a valuable source of revenue that for a considerable time it must be a principal source that at this moment it is an essential one but we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject if we do not call to mind in our calculations that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the variations both in the extent and the kind of imports and that these variations do not correspond with the progress of population which must be the general measure of the public wants as long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers multiply as soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands not called for by agriculture the imported manufactures will decrease as the numbers of people increase,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> in a more remote stage the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation and will therefore require rather the encouragement of bounties than to be loaded with discouraging duties a system of government meant for duration ought to contemplate these revolutions and be able to accommodate itself to them some who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation have grounded a very fierce attack against the constitution on the language in which it is defined it has been urged and echoed that the power `` to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states '' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare no stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections than their stooping to such a misconstruction had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congress been found in the constitution than the general expressions just cited the authors of the objection might have had some color for it though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases a power to destroy the freedom of the press the trial by jury or even to regulate the course of descents or the forms of conveyances must be very singularly expressed by the terms `` to raise money for the general welfare,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O , , O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> `` but what color can the objection have when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification whatsoever for what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> but the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead is an absurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection or on the authors of the constitution we must take the liberty of supposing had not its origin with the latter the objection here is the more extraordinary as it appears that the language used by the convention is a copy from the articles of confederation the objects of the union among the states as described in article third are `` their common defense security of their liberties and mutual and general welfare. `` the terms of article eighth are still more identical `` all charges of war and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare and allowed by the united states in congress shall be defrayed out of a common treasury '' etc a similar language again occurs in article ninth construe either of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on the new constitution and they vest in the existing congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> but what would have been thought of that assembly if attaching themselves to these general expressions and disregarding the specifications which ascertain and limit their import they had exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and general welfare i appeal to the objectors themselves whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning in justification of congress as they now make use of against the convention how difficult it is for error to escape its own condemnation,"O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> it was shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there examined does not require that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each other i shall undertake in the next place to show that unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control over the others the degree of separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free government can never in practice be duly maintained it is agreed on all sides that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly and completely administered by either of the other departments it is equally evident that none of them ought to possess directly or indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers it will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it after discriminating therefore in theory the several classes of power as they may in their nature be legislative executive or judiciary the next and most difficult task is to provide some practical security for each against the invasion of the others,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> what this security ought to be is the great problem to be solved will it be sufficient to mark with precision the boundaries of these departments in the constitution of the government and to trust to these parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power this is the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of the american constitutions but experience assures us that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated and that some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the more feeble against the more powerful members of the government the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex the founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which they have displayed that no task can be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen a respect for truth however obliges us to remark that they seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate supported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority they seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations which by assembling all power in the same hands must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations in a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary monarch the executive department is very justly regarded as the source of danger and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire in a democracy where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative functions and are continually exposed by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted measures to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates tyranny may well be apprehended on some favorable emergency to start up in the same quarter but in a representative republic where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means which reason prescribes it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions the legislative department derives a superiority in our governments from other circumstances its constitutional powers being at once more extensive and less susceptible of precise limits it can with the greater facility mask under complicated and indirect measures the encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments it is not unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies whether the operation of a particular measure will or will not extend beyond the legislative sphere,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> on the other side the executive power being restrained within a narrower compass and being more simple in its nature and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less uncertain projects of usurpation by either of these departments would immediately betray and defeat themselves nor is this all as the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people and has in some constitutions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments a dependence is thus created in the latter which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former i have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what i advance on this subject were it necessary to verify this experience by particular proofs they might be multiplied without end i might find a witness in every citizen who has shared in or been attentive to the course of public administrations i might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every state in the union but as a more concise and at the same time equally satisfactory evidence i will refer to the example of two states attested by two unexceptionable authorities,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the first example is that of virginia a state which as we have seen has expressly declared in its constitution that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed the authority in support of it is mr. jefferson who besides his other advantages for remarking the operation of the government was himself the chief magistrate of it in order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed him on this subject it will be necessary to quote a passage of some length from his very interesting `` notes on the state of virginia '' p. 195 `` all the powers of government legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one one hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not the government we fought for but one which should not only be founded on free principles but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the others for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of government laid its foundation on this basis that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier was provided between these several powers the judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office and some of them for their continuance in it if therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers no opposition is likely to be made nor if made can be effectual because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of acts of assembly which will render them obligatory on the other branches they have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the executive during the whole time of their session is becoming habitual and familiar,"O O O O O O O , O O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` the other state which i shall take for an example is pennsylvania and the other authority the council of censors which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. a part of the duty of this body as marked out by the constitution was `` to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved inviolate in every part and whether the legislative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people or assumed to themselves or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the constitution. `` in the execution of this trust the council were necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and executive proceedings with the constitutional powers of these departments and from the facts enumerated and to the truth of most of which both sides in the council subscribed it appears that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in a variety of important instances a great number of laws had been passed violating without any apparent necessity the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against improper acts of legislature the constitutional trial by jury had been violated and powers assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution executive powers had been usurped the salaries of the judges which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed had been occasionally varied and cases belonging to the judiciary department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and determination those who wish to see the several particulars falling under each of these heads may consult the journals of the council which are in print some of them it will be found may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the war but the greater part of them may be considered as the spontaneous shoots of an ill-constituted government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it appears also that the executive department had not been innocent of frequent breaches of the constitution there are three observations however which ought to be made on this head first a great proportion of the instances were either immediately produced by the necessities of the war or recommended by congress or the commander-in-chief secondly in most of the other instances they conformed either to the declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department thirdly the executive department of pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other states by the number of members composing it in this respect it has as much affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council and being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility for the acts of the body and deriving confidence from mutual example and joint influence unauthorized measures would of course be more freely hazarded than where the executive department is administered by a single hand or by a few hands,"O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the conclusion which i am warranted in drawing from these observations is that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."

<bos> in reviewing the defects of the existing confederation and showing that they can not be supplied by a government of less energy than that before the public several of the most important principles of the latter fell of course under consideration but as the ultimate object of these papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this constitution and the expediency of adopting it our plan can not be complete without taking a more critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention without examining it on all its sides comparing it in all its parts and calculating its probable effects,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> that this remaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to a just and fair result some reflections must in this place be indulged which candor previously suggests,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> it is a misfortune inseparable from human affairs that public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or obstruct the public good and that this spirit is more apt to be diminished than promoted by those occasions which require an unusual exercise of it to those who have been led by experience to attend to this consideration it could not appear surprising that the act of the convention which recommends so many important changes and innovations which may be viewed in so many lights and relations and which touches the springs of so many passions and interests should find or excite dispositions unfriendly both on one side and on the other to a fair discussion and accurate judgment of its merits in some it has been too evident from their own publications that they have scanned the proposed constitution not only with a predisposition to censure but with a predetermination to condemn as the language held by others betrays an opposite predetermination or bias which must render their opinions also of little moment in the question in placing however these different characters on a level with respect to the weight of their opinions i wish not to insinuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions it is but just to remark in favor of the latter description that as our situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical and to require indispensably that something should be done for our relief the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have taken his bias from the weight of these considerations as well as from considerations of a sinister nature the predetermined adversary on the other hand can have been governed by no venial motive whatever the intentions of the first may be upright as they may on the contrary be culpable the views of the last can not be upright and must be culpable but the truth is that these papers are not addressed to persons falling under either of these characters they solicit the attention of those only who add to a sincere zeal for the happiness of their country a temper favorable to a just estimate of the means of promoting it,"O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the plan submitted by the convention not only without a disposition to find or to magnify faults but will see the propriety of reflecting that a faultless plan was not to be expected nor will they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to which the convention as a body of men were liable but will keep in mind that they themselves also are but men and ought not to assume an infallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> with equal readiness will it be perceived that besides these inducements to candor many allowances ought to be made for the difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to the convention,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us it has been shown in the course of these papers that the existing confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious that we must consequently change this first foundation and with it the superstructure resting upon it it has been shown that the other confederacies which could be consulted as precedents have been vitiated by the same erroneous principles and can therefore furnish no other light than that of beacons which give warning of the course to be shunned without pointing out that which ought to be pursued the most that the convention could do in such a situation was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other countries as well as of our own and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors as future experiences may unfold them,"O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> among the difficulties encountered by the convention a very important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in government with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the republican form without substantially accomplishing this part of their undertaking they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment or the expectation of the public yet that it could not be easily accomplished will be denied by no one who is unwilling to betray his ignorance of the subject energy in government is essential to that security against external and internal danger and to that prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very definition of good government stability in government is essential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people which are among the chief blessings of civil society an irregular and mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to the people and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of this country enlightened as they are with regard to the nature and interested as the great body of them are in the effects of good government will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the state administrations on comparing however these valuable ingredients with the vital principles of liberty we must perceive at once the difficulty of mingling them together in their due proportions the genius of republican liberty seems to demand on one side not only that all power should be derived from the people but that those intrusted with it should be kept in independence on the people by a short duration of their appointments and that even during this short period the trust should be placed not in a few but a number of hands stability on the contrary requires that the hands in which power is lodged should continue for a length of time the same a frequent change of men will result from a frequent return of elections and a frequent change of measures from a frequent change of men whilst energy in government requires not only a certain duration of power but the execution of it by a single hand,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> how far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their work will better appear on a more accurate view of it from the cursory view here taken it must clearly appear to have been an arduous part,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of partition between the authority of the general and that of the state governments every man will be sensible of this difficulty in proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate and discriminate objects extensive and complicated in their nature the faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined with satisfactory precision by all the efforts of the most acute and metaphysical philosophers sense perception judgment desire volition memory imagination are found to be separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations and remain a pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy the boundaries between the great kingdom of nature and still more between the various provinces and lesser portions into which they are subdivided afford another illustration of the same important truth the most sagacious and laborious naturalists have never yet succeeded in tracing with certainty the line which separates the district of vegetable life from the neighboring region of unorganized matter or which marks the ermination of the former and the commencement of the animal empire a still greater obscurity lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects in each of these great departments of nature have been arranged and assorted,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> when we pass from the works of nature in which all the delineations are perfectly accurate and appear to be otherwise only from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them to the institutions of man in which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated we must perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity experience has instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define with sufficient certainty its three great provinces the legislative executive and judiciary or even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches questions daily occur in the course of practice which prove the obscurity which reins in these subjects and which puzzle the greatest adepts in political science,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the experience of ages with the continued and combined labors of the most enlightened legislatures and jurists has been equally unsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of different codes of laws and different tribunals of justice the precise extent of the common law and the statute law the maritime law the ecclesiastical law the law of corporations and other local laws and customs remains still to be clearly and finally established in great britain where accuracy in such subjects has been more industriously pursued than in any other part of the world the jurisdiction of her several courts general and local of law of equity of admiralty etc. is not less a source of frequent and intricate discussions sufficiently denoting the indeterminate limits by which they are respectively circumscribed all new laws though penned with the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications besides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects and the imperfection of the human faculties the medium through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment the use of words is to express ideas perspicuity therefore requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly formed but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them but no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea or so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in themselves and however accurately the discrimination may be considered the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered and this unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined when the almighty himself condescends to address mankind in their own language his meaning luminous as it must be is rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> here then are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions indistinctness of the object imperfection of the organ of conception inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas any one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity the convention in delineating the boundary between the federal and state jurisdictions must have experienced the full effect of them all,"O , , O O O O O O O : O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> to the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering pretensions of the larger and smaller states we can not err in supposing that the former would contend for a participation in the government fully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance and that the latter would not be less tenacious of the equality at present enjoyed by them we may well suppose that neither side would entirely yield to the other and consequently that the struggle could be terminated only by compromise it is extremely probable also that after the ratio of representation had been adjusted this very compromise must have produced a fresh struggle between the same parties to give such a turn to the organization of the government and to the distribution of its powers as would increase the importance of the branches in forming which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence there are features in the constitution which warrant each of these suppositions and as far as either of them is well founded it shows that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous considerations,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nor could it have been the large and small states only which would marshal themselves in opposition to each other on various points other combinations resulting from a difference of local position and policy must have created additional difficulties as every state may be divided into different districts and its citizens into different classes which give birth to contending interests and local jealousies so the different parts of the united states are distinguished from each other by a variety of circumstances which produce a like effect on a larger scale and although this variety of interests for reasons sufficiently explained in a former paper may have a salutary influence on the administration of the government when formed yet every one must be sensible of the contrary influence which must have been experienced in the task of forming it,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> would it be wonderful if under the pressure of all these difficulties the convention should have been forced into some deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry which an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a constitution planned in his closet or in his imagination the real wonder is that so many difficulties should have been surmounted and surmounted with a unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected it is impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without partaking of the astonishment it is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution,"O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> we had occasion in a former paper to take notice of the repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the united netherlands for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their constitution the history of almost all the great councils and consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant opinions assuaging their mutual jealousies and adjusting their respective interests is a history of factions contentions and disappointments and may be classed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human character if in a few scattered instances a brighter aspect is presented they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the general truth and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted in revolving the causes from which these exceptions result and applying them to the particular instances before us we are necessarily led to two important conclusions the first is that the convention must have enjoyed in a very singular degree an exemption from the pestilential influence of party animosities the disease most incident to deliberative bodies and most apt to contaminate their proceedings the second conclusion is that all the deputations composing the convention were satisfactorily accommodated by the final act or were induced to accede to it by a deep conviction of the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests to the public good and by a despair of seeing this necessity diminished by delays or by new experiments,"O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` the indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of government carries its own evidence with it it is a power exercised by every legislature of the union i might say of the world by virtue of its general supremacy without it not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity but a dependence of the members of the general government on the state comprehending the seat of the government for protection in the exercise of their duty might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy this consideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single state and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government as still further to abridge its necessary independence the extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature and as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the state ceding it as the state will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them as a municipal legislature for local purposes derived from their own suffrages will of course be allowed them and as the authority of the legislature of the state and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it to concur in the cession will be derived from the whole people of the state in their adoption of the constitution every imaginable objection seems to be obviated the necessity of a like authority over forts magazines etc established by the general government is not less evident the public money expended on such places and the public property deposited in them requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular state nor would it be proper for the places on which the security of the entire union may depend to be in any degree dependent on a particular member of it all objections and scruples are here also obviated by requiring the concurrence of the states concerned in every such establishment,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> `` in a confederacy founded on republican principles and composed of republican members the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial innovations the more intimate the nature of such a union may be the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into should be substantially maintained but a right implies a remedy and where else could the remedy be deposited than where it is deposited by the constitution governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort than those of a kindred nature `` as the confederate republic of germany '' says montesquieu `` consists of free cities and petty states subject to different princes experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of holland and switzerland. `` `` greece was undone '' he adds `` as soon as the king of macedon obtained a seat among the amphictyons '' in the latter case no doubt the disproportionate force as well as the monarchical form of the new confederate had its share of influence on the events it may possibly be asked what need there could be of such a precaution and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the state governments without the concurrence of the states themselves,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> these questions admit of ready answers if the interposition of the general government should not be needed the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the constitution but who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular states by the ambition of enterprising leaders or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers to the second question it may be answered that if the general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority it will be of course bound to pursue the authority but the authority extends no further than to a guaranty of a republican form of government which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to be guaranteed as long therefore as the existing republican forms are continued by the states they are guaranteed by the federal constitution whenever the states may choose to substitute other republican forms they have a right to do so and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter the only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican constitutions a restriction which it is presumed will hardly be considered as a grievance,"O O O O O O .

<bos> a protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it the latitude of the expression here used seems to secure each state not only against foreign hostility but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors the history both of ancient and modern confederacies proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety it has been remarked that even among the swiss cantons which properly speaking are not under one government provision is made for this object and the history of that league informs us that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded and as well by the most democratic as the other cantons a recent and well-known event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature at first view it might seem not to square with the republican theory to suppose either that a majority have not the right or that a minority will have the force to subvert a government and consequently that the federal interposition can never be required but when it would be improper but theoretic reasoning in this as in most other cases must be qualified by the lessons of practice why may not illicit combinations for purposes of violence be formed as well by a majority of a state especially a small state as by a majority of a county or a district of the same state and if the authority of the state ought in the latter case to protect the local magistracy ought not the federal authority in the former to support the state authority besides there are certain parts of the state constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal constitution that a violent blow can not be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other insurrections in a state will rarely induce a federal interposition unless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government it will be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the superintending power than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest the existence of a right to interpose will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments may not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources of military talents and experience or of secret succors from foreign powers as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword may not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the inhabitants or which determine the event of an election may it not happen in fine that the minority of citizens may become a majority of persons by the accession of alien residents of a casual concourse of adventurers or of those whom the constitution of the state has not admitted to the rights of suffrage i take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the states who during the calm of regular government are sunk below the level of men but who in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence may emerge into the human character and give a superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate themselves in cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies what better umpires could be desired by two violent factions flying to arms and tearing a state to pieces than the representatives of confederate states not heated by the local flame to the impartiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind should it be asked what is to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the states and comprising a superiority of the entire force though not a constitutional right the answer must be that such a case as it would be without the compass of human remedies so it is fortunately not within the compass of human probability and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal constitution that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible constitution can provide a cure among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by montesquieu an important one is `` that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the states the others are able to quell it should abuses creep into one part they are reformed by those that remain sound. ``,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> perhaps also an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact itself it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation that in many of the states it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification the principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation on the other states should be reduced to the same standard a compact between independent sovereigns founded on ordinary acts of legislative authority can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties it is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty and that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the others and authorizes them if they please to pronounce the compact violated and void should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular states to a dissolution of the federal pact will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted the time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits the scene is now changed and with it the part which the same motives dictate,"O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the second question is not less delicate and the flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it it is one of those cases which must be left to provide for itself in general it may be observed that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting states yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled the claims of justice both on one side and on the other will be in force and must be fulfilled the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected whilst considerations of a common interest and above all the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion will it is hoped not urge in vain moderation on one side and prudence on the other,"O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> having shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal government is unnecessary or improper the next question to be considered is whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the several states the adversaries to the plan of the convention instead of considering in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the particular states but if the union as has been shown be essential to the security of the people of america against foreign danger if it be essential to their security against contentions and wars among the different states if it be essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter the blessings of liberty and against those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain if in a word the union be essential to the happiness of the people of america is it not preposterous to urge as an objection to a government without which the objects of the union can not be attained that such a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual states was then the american revolution effected was the american confederacy formed was the precious blood of thousands spilt and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished not that the people of america should enjoy peace liberty and safety but that the government of the individual states that particular municipal establishments might enjoy a certain extent of power and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty we have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings not kings for the people is the same doctrine to be revived in the new in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good the real welfare of the great body of the people is the supreme object to be pursued and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness my voice would be reject the plan were the union itself inconsistent with the public happiness it would be abolish the union in like manner as far as the sovereignty of the states can not be reconciled to the happiness of the people the voice of every good citizen must be let the former be sacrificed to the latter how far the sacrifice is necessary has been shown how far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered is the question before us several important considerations have been touched in the course of these papers which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the state governments the more i revolve the subject the more fully i am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> we have seen in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members to despoil the general government of its authorities with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the encroachments although in most of these examples the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the former yet as the states will retain under the proposed constitution a very extensive portion of active sovereignty the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded in the achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of power which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention the lycian confederacy as far as its principles and form are transmitted must have borne a still greater analogy to it yet history does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to degenerate into one consolidated government on the contrary we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions and finally the disunion of the subordinate authorities these cases are the more worthy of our attention as the external causes by which the component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and powerful than in our case and consequently less powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the head and to each other,"O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the feudal system we have seen a similar propensity exemplified notwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns and the people and the sympathy in some instances between the general sovereign and the latter it usually happened that the local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination and particularly had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the people the great kingdoms in europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons the state government will have the advantage of the federal government whether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other to the weight of personal influence which each side will possess to the powers respectively vested in them to the predilection and probable support of the people to the disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other the state governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of the federal government whilst the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization of the former without the intervention of the state legislatures the president of the united states can not be elected at all they must in all cases have a great share in his appointment and will perhaps in most cases of themselves determine it the senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the state legislatures even the house of representatives though drawn immediately from the people will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election into the state legislatures thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the state governments and must consequently feel a dependence which is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them,"O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> on the other side the component parts of the state governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government and very little if at all to the local influence of its members the number of individuals employed under the constitution of the united states will be much smaller than the number employed under the particular states there will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former than of the latter the members of the legislative executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more states the justices of peace officers of militia ministerial officers of justice with all the county corporation and town officers for three millions and more of people intermixed and having particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people must exceed beyond all proportion both in number and influence those of every description who will be employed in the administration of the federal system compare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen states excluding from the judiciary department the justices of peace with the members of the corresponding departments of the single government of the union compare the militia officers of three millions of people with the military and marine officers of any establishment which is within the compass of probability or i may add of possibility and in this view alone we may pronounce the advantage of the states to be decisive if the federal government is to have collectors of revenue the state governments will have theirs also and as those of the former will be principally on the seacoast and not very numerous whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the country and will be very numerous the advantage in this view also lies on the same side,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> it is true that the confederacy is to possess and may exercise the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the states but it is probable that this power will not be resorted to except for supplemental purposes of revenue that an option will then be given to the states to supply their quotas by previous collections of their own and that the eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union will generally be made by the officers and according to the rules appointed by the several states indeed it is extremely probable that in other instances particularly in the organization of the judicial power the officers of the states will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the union should it happen however that separate collectors of internal revenue should be appointed under the federal government the influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of state officers in the opposite scale within every district to which a federal collector would be allotted there would not be less than thirty or forty or even more officers of different descriptions and many of them persons of character and weight whose influence would lie on the side of the state the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected,"O O O , O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger those of the state governments in times of peace and security as the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government the more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular states if the new constitution be examined with accuracy and candor it will be found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of new powers to the union than in the invigoration of its original powers the regulation of commerce it is true is a new power but that seems to be an addition which few oppose and from which no apprehensions are entertained the powers relating to war and peace armies and fleets treaties and finance with the other more considerable powers are all vested in the existing congress by the articles of confederation the proposed change does not enlarge these powers it only substitutes a more effectual mode of administering them,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O , , O O O O , O O O , , O O O O .

<bos> the change relating to taxation may be regarded as the most important and yet the present congress have as complete authority to require of the states indefinite supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare as the future congress will have to require them of individual citizens and the latter will be no more bound than the states themselves have been to pay the quotas respectively taxed on them had the states complied punctually with the articles of confederation or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with success towards single persons our past experience is very far from countenancing an opinion that the state governments would have lost their constitutional powers and have gradually undergone an entire consolidation to maintain that such an event would have ensued would be to say at once that the existence of the state governments is incompatible with any system whatever that accomplishes the essental purposes of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> resuming the subject of the last paper i proceed to inquire whether the federal government or the state governments will have the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the people notwithstanding the different modes in which they are appointed we must consider both of them as substantially dependent on the great body of the citizens of the united states i assume this position here as it respects the first reserving the proofs for another place the federal and state governments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people constituted with different powers and designed for different purposes the adversaries of the constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this subject and to have viewed these different establishments not only as mutual rivals and enemies but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other these gentlemen must here be reminded of their error they must be told that the ultimate authority wherever the derivative may be found resides in the people alone and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the different governments whether either or which of them will be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the other,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> truth no less than decency requires that the event in every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their common constituents many considerations besides those suggested on a former occasion seem to place it beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their respective states into the administration of these a greater number of individuals will expect to rise from the gift of these a greater number of offices and emoluments will flow by the superintending care of these all the more domestic and personal interests of the people will be regulated and provided for with the affairs of these the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant and with the members of these will a greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship and of family and party attachments on the side of these therefore the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to incline experience speaks the same language in this case the federal administration though hitherto very defective in comparison with what may be hoped under a better system had during the war and particularly whilst the independent fund of paper emissions was in credit an activity and importance as great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever it was engaged too in a course of measures which had for their object the protection of everything that was dear and the acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people at large,"O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it was nevertheless invariably found after the transient enthusiasm for the early congresses was over that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular governments that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor and that opposition to proposed enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence on the prepossessions of their fellow-citizens if therefore as has been elsewhere remarked the people should in future become more partial to the federal than to the state governments the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs of a better administration as will overcome all their antecedent propensities and in that case the people ought not surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover it to be most due but even in that case the state governments could have little to apprehend because it is only within a certain sphere that the federal power can in the nature of things be advantageously administered the remaining points on which i propose to compare the federal and state governments are the disposition and the faculty they may respectively possess to resist and frustrate the measures of each other it has been already proved that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the state governments than the latter will be on the former,"O O , , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> it has appeared also that the prepossessions of the people on whom both will depend will be more on the side of the state governments than of the federal government so far as the disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these causes the state governments must clearly have the advantage but in a distinct and very important point of view the advantage will lie on the same side the prepossessions which the members themselves will carry into the federal government will generally be favorable to the states whilst it will rarely happen that the members of the state governments will carry into the public councils a bias in favor of the general government a local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of congress than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the particular states,"O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the state legislatures proceeds from the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interest of the state to the particular and separate views of the counties or districts in which they reside and if they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular state how can it be imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the union and the dignity and respectability of its government the objects of their affections and consultations for the same reason that the members of the state legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects the states will be to the latter what counties and towns are to the former measures will too often be decided according to their probable effect not on the national prosperity and happiness but on the prejudices interests and pursuits of the governments and people of the individual states what is the spirit that has in general characterized the proceedings of congress a perusal of their journals as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly will inform us that the members have but too frequently displayed the character rather of partisans of their respective states than of impartial guardians of a common interest that where on one occasion improper sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the aggrandizement of the federal government the great interests of the nation have suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to the local prejudices interests and views of the particular states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i mean not by these reflections to insinuate that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government may have pursued much less that its views will be as confined as those of the state legislatures but only that it will partake sufficiently of the spirit of both to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual states or the preorgatives of their governments the motives on the part of the state governments to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government will be overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members were it admitted however that the federal government may feel an equal disposition with the state governments to extend its power beyond the due limits the latter would still have the advantage in the means of defeating such encroachments if an act of a particular state though unfriendly to the national government be generally popular in that state and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the state officers it is executed immediately and of course by means on the spot and depending on the state alone the opposition of the federal government or the interposition of federal officers would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the state and the evil could not be prevented or repaired if at all without the employment of means which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> on the other hand should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular states which would seldom fail to be the case or even a warrantable measure be so which may sometimes be the case the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand the disquietude of the people their repugnance and perhaps refusal to co-operate with the officers of the union the frowns of the executive magistracy of the state the embarrassments created by legislative devices which would often be added on such occasions would oppose in any state difficulties not to be despised would form in a large state very serious impediments and where the sentiments of several adjoining states happened to be in unison would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter but ambitious encroachments of the federal government on the authority of the state governments would not excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states only they would be signals of general alarm every government would espouse the common cause a correspondence would be opened plans of resistance would be concerted one spirit would animate and conduct the whole the same combinations in short would result from an apprehension of the federal as was produced by the dread of a foreign yoke and unless the projected innovations should be voluntarily renounced the same appeal to a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the other but what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity in the contest with great britain one part of the empire was employed against the other the more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous part the attempt was unjust and unwise but it was not in speculation absolutely chimerical but what would be the contest in the case we are supposing who would be the parties a few representatives of the people would be opposed to the people themselves or rather one set of representatives would be contending against thirteen sets of representatives with the whole body of their common constituents on the side of the latter,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the state governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition the reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger that the people and the states should for a sufficient period of time elect an uninterupted succession of men ready to betray both that the traitors should throughout this period uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment that the governments and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm and continue to supply the materials until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> extravagant as the supposition is let it however be made let a regular army fully equal to the resources of the country be formed and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government still it would not be going too far to say that the state governments with the people on their side would be able to repel the danger the highest number to which according to the best computation a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms this proportion would not yield in the united states an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men to these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands officered by men chosen from among themselves fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence it may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the british arms will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms and it is not certain that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes but were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves who could collect the national will and direct the national force and of officers appointed out of the militia by these governments and attached both to them and to the militia it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it,"O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of america with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must precede and produce it the argument under the present head may be put into a very concise form which appears altogether conclusive either the mode in which the federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently dependent on the people or it will not on the first supposition it will be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents on the other supposition it will not possess the confidence of the people and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the state governments who will be supported by the people on summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence that the powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual states as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the union and that all those alarms which have been sounded of a meditated and consequential annihilation of the state governments must on the most favorable interpretation be ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` the prohibition against treaties alliances and confederations makes a part of the existing articles of union and for reasons which need no explanation is copied into the new constitution the prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system but is somewhat extended in the new according to the former letters of marque could be granted by the states after a declaration of war according to the latter these licenses must be obtained as well during war as previous to its declaration from the government of the united states this alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible the right of coining money which is here taken from the states was left in their hands by the confederation as a concurrent right with that of congress under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of congress to regulate the alloy and value in this instance also the new provision is an improvement on the old whilst the alloy and value depended on the general authority a right of coinage in the particular states could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces the latter inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally submitted to the federal head and as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for recoinage the end can be as well attained by local mints established under the general authority,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity the loss which america has sustained since the peace from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man on the necessary confidence in the public councils on the industry and morals of the people and on the character of republican government constitutes an enormous debt against the states chargeable with this unadvised measure which must long remain unsatisfied or rather an accumulation of guilt which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power which has been the instrument of it in addition to these persuasive considerations it may be observed that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the states the power of regulating coin prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin had every state a right to regulate the value of its coin there might be as many different currencies as states and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded retrospective alterations in its value might be made and thus the citizens of other states be injured and animosities be kindled among the states themselves the subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause and hence the union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member no one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the states to emit paper money than to coin gold or silver the power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts is withdrawn from the states on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> bills of attainder ex-post-facto laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound legislation the two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters our own experience has taught us nevertheless that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted very properly therefore have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights and i am much deceived if they have not in so doing as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents the sober people of america are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils they have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences in cases affecting personal rights become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators and snares to the more-industrious and lessinformed part of the community they have seen too that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding they very rightly infer therefore that some thorough reform is wanting which will banish speculations on public measures inspire a general prudence and industry and give a regular course to the business of society the prohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of confederation and needs no comment,"O O O , O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> `` few parts of the constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this yet on a fair investigation of it no part can appear more completely invulnerable without the substance of this power the whole constitution would be a dead letter those who object to the article therefore as a part of the constitution can only mean that the form of the provision is improper but have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted there are four other possible methods which the constitution might have taken on this subject they might have copied the second article of the existing confederation which would have prohibited the exercise of any power not expressly delegated they might have attempted a positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms `` necessary and proper '' they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition they might have been altogether silent on the subject leaving these necessary and proper powers to construction and inference,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second article of confederation it is evident that the new congress would be continually exposed as their predecessors have been to the alternative of construing the term `` expressly '' with so much rigor as to disarm the government of all real authority whatever or with so much latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction it would be easy to show if it were necessary that no important power delegated by the articles of confederation has been or can be executed by congress without recurring more or less to the doctrine of construction or implication as the powers delegated under the new system are more extensive the government which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing nothing or of violating the constitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper but at the same time not expressly granted,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect the attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the constitution relates accommodated too not only to the existing state of things but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce for in every new application of a general power the particular powers which are the means of attaining the object of the general power must always necessarily vary with that object and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution the task would have been no less chimerical and would have been liable to this further objection that every defect in the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of authority if to avoid this consequence they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions and described the residue by the general terms not necessary or proper it must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only that these would be such as would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated because the enumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or proper and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum would be less forcibly excepted than if no partial enumeration had been made had the constitution been silent on this head there can be no doubt that all the particular powers requisite as means of executing the general powers would have resulted to the government by unavoidable implication no axiom is more clearly established in law or in reason than that wherever the end is required the means are authorized wherever a general power to do a thing is given every particular power necessary for doing it is included had this last method therefore been pursued by the convention every objection now urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the union if it be asked what is to be the consequence in case the congress shall misconstrue this part of the constitution and exercise powers not warranted by its true meaning i answer the same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them as if the general power had been reduced to particulars and any one of these were to be violated the same in short as if the state legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional authorities in the first instance the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can by the election of more faithful representatives annul the acts of the usurpers,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the truth is that this ultimate redress may be more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal than of the state legislatures for this plain reason that as every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of the latter these will be ever ready to mark the innovation to sound the alarm to the people and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal representatives there being no such intermediate body between the state legislatures and the people interested in watching the conduct of the former violations of the state constitutions are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredressed,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the third place as the constitutions of the states differ much from each other it might happen that a treaty or national law of great and equal importance to the states would interfere with some and not with other constitutions and would consequently be valid in some of the states at the same time that it would have no effect in others in fine the world would have seen for the first time a system of government founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all government it would have seen the authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the authority of the parts it would have seen a monster in which the head was under the direction of the members,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the remaining charge against the house of representatives which i am to examine is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time as the progress of population may demand it has been admitted that this objection if well supported would have great weight the following observations will show that like most other objections against the constitution it can only proceed from a partial view of the subject or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures every object which is beheld,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> those who urge the objection seem not to have recollected that the federal constitution will not suffer by a comparison with the state constitutions in the security provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of representatives the number which is to prevail in the first instance is declared to be temporary its duration is limited to the short term of three years within every successive term of ten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated the unequivocal objects of these regulations are first to readjust from time to time the apportionment of representatives to the number of inhabitants under the single exception that each state shall have one representative at least secondly to augment the number of representatives at the same periods under the sole limitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand inhabitants if we review the constitutions of the several states we shall find that some of them contain no determinate regulations on this subject that others correspond pretty much on this point with the federal constitution and that the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a mere directory provision,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as far as experience has taken place on this subject a gradual increase of representatives under the state constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the constituents and it appears that the former have been as ready to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for them,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> there is a peculiarity in the federal constitution which insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the latter the peculiarity lies in this that one branch of the legislature is a representation of citizens the other of the states in the former consequently the larger states will have most weight in the latter the advantage will be in favor of the smaller states from this circumstance it may with certainty be inferred that the larger states will be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature in which their influence predominates and it so happens that four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes in the house of representatives,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> should the representatives or people therefore of the smaller states oppose at any time a reasonable addition of members a coalition of a very few states will be sufficient to overrule the opposition a coalition which notwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might prevent it on ordinary occasions would not fail to take place when not merely prompted by common interest but justified by equity and the principles of the constitution it may be alleged perhaps that the senate would be prompted by like motives to an adverse coalition and as their concurrence would be indispensable the just and constitutional views of the other branch might be defeated this is the difficulty which has probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous friends of a numerous representation fortunately it is among the difficulties which existing only in appearance vanish on a close and accurate inspection the following reflections will if i mistake not be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory on this point notwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects except the originating of money bills it can not be doubted that the house composed of the greater number of members when supported by the more powerful states and speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of the two houses,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this advantage must be increased by the consciousness felt by the same side of being supported in its demands by right by reason and by the constitution and the consciousness on the opposite side of contending against the force of all these solemn considerations it is farther to be considered that in the gradation between the smallest and largest states there are several which though most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former are too little removed in extent and population from the latter to second an opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions hence it is by no means certain that a majority of votes even in the senate would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of representatives it will not be looking too far to add that the senators from all the new states may be gained over to the just views of the house of representatives by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked as these states will for a great length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the representatives to the number of inhabitants the large states therefore who will prevail in the house of representatives will have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations mutually conditions of each other and the senators from all the most growing states will be bound to contend for the latter by the interest which their states will feel in the former these considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it admitting however that they should all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller states or their predominant influence in the councils of the senate a constitutional and infallible resource still remains with the larger states by which they will be able at all times to accomplish their just purposes,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O ; O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the house of representatives can not only refuse but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government they in a word hold the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold in the history of the british constitution an infant and humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance and finally reducing as far as it seems to have wished all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government this power over the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure but will not the house of representatives be as much interested as the senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions and will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or its reputation on the pliancy of the senate or if such a trial of firmness between the two branches were hazarded would not the one be as likely first to yield as the other these questions will create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all cases the smaller the number and the more permanent and conspicuous the station of men in power the stronger must be the interest which they will individually feel in whatever concerns the government,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O . , O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> those who represent the dignity of their country in the eyes of other nations will be particularly sensible to every prospect of public danger or of dishonorable stagnation in public affairs to those causes we are to ascribe the continual triumph of the british house of commons over the other branches of the government whenever the engine of a money bill has been employed an absolute inflexibility on the side of the latter although it could not have failed to involve every department of the state in the general confusion has neither been apprehended nor experienced the utmost degree of firmness that can be displayed by the federal senate or president will not be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be supported by constitutional and patriotic principles in this review of the constitution of the house of representatives i have passed over the circumstances of economy which in the present state of affairs might have had some effect in lessening the temporary number of representatives and a disregard of which would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against the constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number proposed i omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might be found under present circumstances in engaging in the federal service a large number of such characters as the people will probably elect,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> one observation however i must be permitted to add on this subject as claiming in my judgment a very serious attention it is that in all legislative assemblies the greater the number composing them may be the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings in the first place the more numerous an assembly may be of whatever characters composed the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion over reason in the next place the larger the number the greater will be the proportion of members of limited information and of weak capacities now it is precisely on characters of this description that the eloquence and address of the few are known to act with all their force in the ancient republics where the whole body of the people assembled in person a single orator or an artful statesman was generally seen to rule with as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single hand,"O O , , O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O .

<bos> on the same principle the more multitudinous a representative assembly may be rendered the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people ignorance will be the dupe of cunning and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation the people can never err more than in supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a certain limit they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few experience will forever admonish them that on the contrary after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of safety of local information and of diffusive sympathy with the whole society they will counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives the countenance of the government may become more democratic but the soul that animates it will be more oligarchic the machine will be enlarged but the fewer and often the more secret will be the springs by which its motions are directed as connected with the objection against the number of representatives may properly be here noticed that which has been suggested against the number made competent for legislative business it has been said that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum and in particular cases if not in all more than a majority of a quorum for a decision that some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution can not be denied it might have been an additional shield to some particular interests and another obstacle generally to hasty and partial measures but these considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed or active measures to be pursued the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed it would be no longer the majority that would rule the power would be transferred to the minority were the defensive privilege limited to particular cases an interested minority might take advantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal or in particular emergencies to extort unreasonable indulgences lastly it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice of secessions a practice which has shown itself even in states where a majority only is required a practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular government a practice which leads more directly to public convulsions and the ruin of popular governments than any other which has yet been displayed among us,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> among the numerous advantages promised by a wellconstructed union none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction the friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice he will not fail therefore to set a due value on any plan which without violating the principles to which he is attached provides a proper cure for it the instability injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils have in truth been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations the valuable improvements made by the american constitutions on the popular models both ancient and modern can not certainly be too much admired but it would be an unwarrantable partiality to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side as was wished and expected complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens equally the friends of public and private faith and of public and personal liberty that our governments are too unstable that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties and that measures are too often decided not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority however anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true it will be found indeed on a candid review of our situation that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments but it will be found at the same time that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes and particularly for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements and alarm for private rights which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other these must be chiefly if not wholly effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> by a faction i understand a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adversed to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community,"O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction the one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects,"O O O O O O O O O O : O , O O O ; O , O O O ."
<bos> there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction the one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions the same passions and the same interests,"O O O O O O O O O O O : O , O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O , O O , O O O ."
<bos> it could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that it was worse than the disease liberty is to faction what air is to fire an aliment without which it instantly expires but it could not be less folly to abolish liberty which is essential to political life because it nourishes faction than it would be to wish the annihilation of air which is essential to animal life because it imparts to fire its destructive agency,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise as long as the reason of man continues fallible and he is at liberty to exercise it different opinions will be formed as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves the diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests the protection of these faculties is the first object of government from the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties,"O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity according to the different circumstances of civil society a zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning government and many other points as well of speculation as of practice an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions have in turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts but the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society those who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination a landed interest a manufacturing interest a mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes actuated by different sentiments and views the regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O , O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause because his interest would certainly bias his judgment and not improbably corrupt his integrity with equal nay with greater reason a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation but so many judicial determinations not indeed concerning the rights of single persons but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens and what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine is a law proposed concerning private debts it is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other justice ought to hold the balance between them yet the parties are and must be themselves the judges and the most numerous party or in other words the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail shall domestic manufactures be encouraged and in what degree by restrictions on foreign manufactures are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good the apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality yet there is perhaps no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number is a shilling saved to their own pockets,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O , O O .

<bos> it is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests and render them all subservient to the public good enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm nor in many cases can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O . , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction can not be removed and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> if a faction consists of less than a majority relief is supplied by the republican principle which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote it may clog the administration it may convulse the society but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution when a majority is included in a faction the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens to secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> by what means is this object attainable evidently by one of two only either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by their number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression if the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control they are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful,"O O O O O O O ? O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> from this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy by which i mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens who assemble and administer the government in person can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction a common passion or interest will in almost every case be felt by a majority of the whole a communication and concert result from the form of government itself and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions their opinions and their passions,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a republic by which i mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place opens a different prospect and promises the cure for which we are seeking let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the union,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are first the delegation of the government in the latter to a small number of citizens elected by the rest secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O : , O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> the effect of the first difference is on the one hand to refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations under such a regulation it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose on the other hand the effect may be inverted men of factious tempers of local prejudices or of sinister designs may by intrigue by corruption or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the interests of the people the question resulting is whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations,"O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O . O O O , O O O O . O O O , O O , O O O , , O , O , O O O , O O O , O O O O , O O .

<bos> in the first place it is to be remarked that however small the republic may be the representatives must be raised to a certain number in order to guard against the cabals of a few and that however large it may be they must be limited to a certain number in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude hence the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents and being proportionally greater in the small republic it follows that if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic the former will present a greater option and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice,"O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> in the next place as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried and the suffrages of the people being more free will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it must be confessed that in this as in most other cases there is a mean on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie by enlarging too much the number of electors you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests as by reducing it too much you render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects the federal constitution forms a happy combination in this respect the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national the local and particular to the state legislatures,"O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the other point of difference is the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter the smaller the society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it the fewer the distinct parties and interests the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other besides other impediments it may be remarked that where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> hence it clearly appears that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republic -- is enjoyed by the union over the states composing it does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice it will not be denied that the representation of the union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest in an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the union increase this security does it in fine consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority here again the extent of the union gives it the most palpable advantage,"O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states a religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source a rage for paper money for an abolition of debts for an equal division of property or for any other improper or wicked project will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union than a particular member of it in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district than an entire state,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the extent and proper structure of the union therefore we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government and according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of federalists,"O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> we have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against foreign danger as the conservator of peace among ourselves as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the old world and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction which have proved fatal to other popular governments and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own all that remains within this branch of our inquiries is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces a few observations on this subject will be the more proper as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration in order to supply by imaginary difficulties the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to find,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers i remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter the true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion it is that in a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be extended over a large region,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O O O O O . O , , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> to this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated authors whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political opinions being subjects either of an absolute or limited monarchy they have endeavored to heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of those forms by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient greece and modern italy under the confusion of names it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only and among others the observation that it can never be established but among a small number of people living within a small compass of territory,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species and even in modern europe to which we owe the great principle of representation no example is seen of a government wholly popular and founded at the same time wholly on that principle if europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be concentred and its force directed to any object which the public good requires america can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics it is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her consideration,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand and will include no greater number than can join in those functions so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs can it be said that the limits of the united states exceed this distance it will not be said by those who recollect that the atlantic coast is the longest side of the union that during the term of thirteen years the representatives of the states have been almost continually assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from the states in the neighborhood of congress,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the union the limits as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the east the atlantic on the south the latitude of thirty-one degrees on the west the mississippi and on the north an irregular line running in some instances beyond the forty-fifth degree in others falling as low as the forty-second the southern shore of lake erie lies below that latitude computing the distance between the thirty-first and forty-fifth degrees it amounts to nine hundred and seventy-three common miles computing it from thirty-one to forty-two degrees to seven hundred and sixty-four miles and a half taking the mean for the distance the amount will be eight hundred and sixty-eight miles and three-fourths the mean distance from the atlantic to the mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles on a comparison of this extent with that of several countries in europe the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable it is not a great deal larger than germany where a diet representing the whole empire is continually assembled or than poland before the late dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power passing by france and spain we find that in great britain inferior as it may be in size the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O O O O , : O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> favorable as this view of the subject may be some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> in the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects which concern all the members of the republic but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any the subordinate governments which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided for will retain their due authority and activity were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular states its adversaries would have some ground for their objection though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be compelled by the principle of self-preservation to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive states which we know to be practicable and to add to them such other states as may arise in their own bosoms or in their neighborhoods which we can not doubt to be equally practicable the arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> let it be remarked in the third place that the intercourse throughout the union will be facilitated by new improvements roads will everywhere be shortened and kept in better order accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout or nearly throughout the whole extent of the thirteen states the communication between the western and atlantic districts and between different parts of each will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our country and which part finds it so little difficult to connect and complete,"O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a fourth and still more important consideration is that as almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier and will thus find in regard to its safety an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection so the states which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the union and which of course may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations and will consequently stand on particular occasions in greatest need of its strength and resources it may be inconvenient for georgia or the states forming our western or northeastern borders to send their representatives to the seat of government but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading enemy or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual danger if they should derive less benefit therefore from the union in some respects than the less distant states they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O , O O , O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> i submit to you my fellow-citizens these considerations in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect and that you will never suffer difficulties however formidable in appearance or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of america knit together as they are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as members of the same family can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be fellowcitizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against this unhallowed language shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys the kindred blood which flows in the veins of american citizens the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights consecrate their union and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens rivals enemies and if novelties are to be shunned believe me the most alarming of all novelties the most wild of all projects the most rash of all attempts is that of rendering us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness but why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new is it not the glory of the people of america that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity for custom or for names to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense the knowledge of their own situation and the lessons of their own experience to this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for the possession and the world for the example of the numerous innovations displayed on the american theatre in favor of private rights and public happiness had no important step been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered no government established of which an exact model did not present itself the people of the united states might at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind happily for america happily we trust for the whole human race they pursued a new and more noble course they accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society they reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe they formed the design of a great confederacy which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate if their works betray imperfections we wonder at the fewness of them if they erred most in the structure of the union this was the work most difficult to be executed this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide,"O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there is hardly any part of the system which could have been atten ed with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than this and there is perhaps none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> here the writers against the constitution seem to have taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy they have endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in opposition to the intended president of the united states not merely as the embryo but as the full-grown progeny of that detested parent to establish the pretended affinity they have not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction the authorities of a magistrate in few instances greater in some instances less than those of a governor of new york have been magnified into more than royal prerogatives he has been decorated with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a king of great britain he has been shown to us with the diadem sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his train he has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and mistresses giving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates in all the supercilious pomp of majesty the images of asiatic despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown the exaggerated scene we have been taught to tremble at the terrific visages of murdering janizaries and to blush at the unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or it might rather be said to metamorphose the object render it necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form in order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance as to unmask the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the counterfeit resemblances which have been so insidiously as well as industriously propagated,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , ."
<bos> in the execution of this task there is no man who would not find it an arduous effort either to behold with moderation or to treat with seriousness the devices not less weak than wicked which have been contrived to pervert the public opinion in relation to the subject they so far exceed the usual though unjustifiable licenses of party artifice that even in a disposition the most candid and tolerant they must force the sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and unreserved indignation it is impossible not to bestow the imputation of deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a similitude between a king of great britain and a magistrate of the character marked out for that of the president of the united states it is still more impossible to withhold that imputation from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to give success to the attempted imposition in one instance which i cite as a sample of the general spirit the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to the president of the united states a power which by the instrument reported is expressly allotted to the executives of the individual states i mean the power of filling casual vacancies in the senate,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this bold experiment upon the discernment of his countrymen has been hazarded by a writer who whatever may be his real merit has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of his party1 and who upon this false and unfounded suggestion has built a series of observations equally false and unfounded let him now be confronted with the evidence of the fact and let him if he be able justify or extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of truth and to the rules of fair dealing,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ( O O O O O ) O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the second clause of the second section of the second article empowers the president of the united states `` to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of united states whose appointments are not in the constitution otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law '' immediately after this clause follows another in these words `` the president shall have power to fill up vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session '' it is from this last provision that the pretended power of the president to fill vacancies in the senate has been deduced a slight attention to the connection of the clauses and to the obvious meaning of the terms will satisfy us that the deduction is not even colorable,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> the first of these two clauses it is clear only provides a mode for appointing such officers `` whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the constitution and which shall be established by law '' of course it can not extend to the appointments of senators whose appointments are otherwise provided for in the constitution2 and who are established by the constitution and will not require a future establishment by law this position will hardly be contested,"O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O ."
<bos> the last of these two clauses it is equally clear can not be understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies in the senate for the following reasons first the relation in which that clause stands to the other which declares the general mode of appointing officers of the united states denotes it to be nothing more than a supplement to the other for the purpose of establishing an auxiliary method of appointment in cases to which the general method was inadequate the ordinary power of appointment is confined to the president and senate jointly and can therefore only be exercised during the session of the senate but as it would have been improper to oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment of officers and as vacancies might happen in their recess which it might be necessary for the public service to fill without delay the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorize the president singly to make temporary appointments `` during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session '',"O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O : . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O"
<bos> secondly if this clause is to be considered as supplementary to the one which precedes the vacancies of which it speaks must be construed to relate to the `` officers '' described in the preceding one and this we have seen excludes from its description the members of the senate thirdly the time within which the power is to operate `` during the recess of the senate '' and the duration of the appointments `` to the end of the next session '' of that body conspire to elucidate the sense of the provision which if it had been intended to comprehend senators would naturally have referred the temporary power of filling vacancies to the recess of the state legislatures who are to make the permanent appointments and not to the recess of the national senate who are to have no concern in those appointments and would have extended the duration in office of the temporary senators to the next session of the legislature of the state in whose representation the vacancies had happened instead of making it to expire at the end of the ensuing session of the national senate the circumstances of the body authorized to make the permanent appointments would of course have governed the modification of a power which related to the temporary appointments and as the national senate is the body whose situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the suggestion under examination has been founded the vacancies to which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the president,"O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O , O O O O O O O O . . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but lastly the first and second clauses of the third section of the first article not only obviate all possibility of doubt but destroy the pretext of misconception the former provides that `` the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature thereof for six years '' and the latter directs that `` if vacancies in that body should happen by resignation or otherwise during the recess of the legislature of any state the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature which shall then fill such vacancies '' here is an express power given in clear and unambiguous terms to the state executives to fill casual vacancies in the senate by temporary appointments which not only invalidates the supposition that the clause before considered could have been intended to confer that power upon the president of the united states but proves that this supposition destitute as it is even of the merit of plausibility must have originated in an intention to deceive the people too palpable to be obscured by sophistry too atrocious to be palliated by hypocrisy,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> i have taken the pains to select this instance of misrepresentation and to place it in a clear and strong light as an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the constitution submitted to the consideration of the people nor have i scrupled in so flagrant a case to allow myself a severity of animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these papers i hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid and honest adversary of the proposed government whether language can furnish epithets of too much asperity for so shameless and so prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of america,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> we have seen that the result of the observations to which the foregoing number has been principally devoted is that from the natural operation of the different interests and views of the various classes of the community whether the representation of the people be more or less numerous it will consist almost entirely of proprietors of land of merchants and of members of the learned professions who will truly represent all those different interests and views if it should be objected that we have seen other descriptions of men in the local legislatures i answer that it is admitted there are exceptions to the rule but not in sufficient number to influence the general complexion or character of the government there are strong minds in every walk of life that will rise superior to the disadvantages of situation and will command the tribute due to their merit not only from the classes to which they particularly belong but from the society in general the door ought to be equally open to all and i trust for the credit of human nature that we shall see examples of such vigorous plants flourishing in the soil of federal as well as of state legislation but occasional instances of this sort will not render the reasoning founded upon the general course of things less conclusive,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the subject might be placed in several other lights that would all lead to the same result and in particular it might be asked what greater affinity or relation of interest can be conceived between the carpenter and blacksmith and the linen manufacturer or stocking weaver than between the merchant and either of them it is notorious that there are often as great rivalships between different branches of the mechanic or manufacturing arts as there are between any of the departments of labor and industry so that unless the representative body were to be far more numerous than would be consistent with any idea of regularity or wisdom in its deliberations it is impossible that what seems to be the spirit of the objection we have been considering should ever be realized in practice but i forbear to dwell any longer on a matter which has hitherto worn too loose a garb to admit even of an accurate inspection of its real shape or tendency,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ?

<bos> there is another objection of a somewhat more precise nature that claims our attention it has been asserted that a power of internal taxation in the national legislature could never be exercised with advantage as well from the want of a sufficient knowledge of local circumstances as from an interference between the revenue laws of the union and of the particular states the supposition of a want of proper knowledge seems to be entirely destitute of foundation if any question is depending in a state legislature respecting one of the counties which demands a knowledge of local details how is it acquired no doubt from the information of the members of the county can not the like knowledge be obtained in the national legislature from the representatives of each state and is it not to be presumed that the men who will generally be sent there will be possessed of the necessary degree of intelligence to be able to communicate that information is the knowledge of local circumstances as applied to taxation a minute topographical acquaintance with all the mountains rivers streams highways and bypaths in each state or is it a general acquaintance with its situation and resources with the state of its agriculture commerce manufactures with the nature of its products and consumptions with the different degrees and kinds of its wealth property and industry,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nations in general even under governments of the more popular kind usually commit the administration of their finances to single men or to boards composed of a few individuals who digest and prepare in the first instance the plans of taxation which are afterwards passed into laws by the authority of the sovereign or legislature,"O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> inquisitive and enlightened statesmen are deemed everywhere best qualified to make a judicious selection of the objects proper for revenue which is a clear indication as far as the sense of mankind can have weight in the question of the species of knowledge of local circumstances requisite to the purposes of taxation,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the taxes intended to be comprised under the general denomination of internal taxes may be subdivided into those of the direct and those of the indirect kind though the objection be made to both yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the former branch and indeed as to the latter by which must be understood duties and excises on articles of consumption one is at a loss to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties apprehended the knowledge relating to them must evidently be of a kind that will either be suggested by the nature of the article itself or can easily be procured from any well-informed man especially of the mercantile class the circumstances that may distinguish its situation in one state from its situation in another must be few simple and easy to be comprehended the principal thing to be attended to would be to avoid those articles which had been previously appropriated to the use of a particular state and there could be no difficulty in ascertaining the revenue system of each this could always be known from the respective codes of laws as well as from the information of the members from the several states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> the objection when applied to real property or to houses and lands appears to have at first sight more foundation but even in this view it will not bear a close examination land taxes are co monly laid in one of two modes either by actual valuations permanent or periodical or by occasional assessments at the discretion or according to the best judgment of certain officers whose duty it is to make them in either case the execution of the business which alone requires the knowledge of local details must be devolved upon discreet persons in the character of commissioners or assessors elected by the people or appointed by the government for the purpose all that the law can do must be to name the persons or to prescribe the manner of their election or appointment to fix their numbers and qualifications and to draw the general outlines of their powers and duties and what is there in all this that can not as well be performed by the national legislature as by a state legislature the attention of either can only reach to general principles local details as already observed must be referred to those who are to execute the plan,"O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but there is a simple point of view in which this matter may be placed that must be altogether satisfactory the national legislature can make use of the system of each state within that state the method of laying and collecting this species of taxes in each state can in all its parts be adopted and employed by the federal government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> let it be recollected that the proportion of these taxes is not to be left to the discretion of the national legislature but is to be determined by the numbers of each state as described in the second section of the first article an actual census or enumeration of the people must furnish the rule a circumstance which effectually shuts the door to partiality or oppression the abuse of this power of taxation seems to have been provided against with guarded circumspection in addition to the precaution just mentioned there is a provision that `` all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the united states '',"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O . O"
<bos> it has been very properly observed by different speakers and writers on the side of the constitution that if the exercise of the power of internal taxation by the union should be discovered on experiment to be really inconvenient the federal government may then forbear the use of it and have recourse to requisitions in its stead by way of answer to this it has been triumphantly asked why not in the first instance omit that ambiguous power and rely upon the latter resource two solid answers may be given the first is that the exercise of that power if convenient will be preferable because it will be more effectual and it is impossible to prove in theory or otherwise than by the experiment that it can not be advantageously exercised the contrary indeed appears most probable the second answer is that the existence of such a power in the constitution will have a strong influence in giving efficacy to requisitions when the states know that the union can apply itself without their agency it will be a powerful motive for exertion on their part,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ? O O O O O . O O , O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O . O , , O O .

<bos> as to the interference of the revenue laws of the union and of its members we have already seen that there can be no clashing or repugnancy of authority the laws can not therefore in a legal sense interfere with each other and it is far from impossible to avoid an interference even in the policy of their different systems an effectual expedient for this purpose will be mutually to abstain from those objects which either side may have first had recourse to as neither can control the other each will have an obvious and sensible interest in this reciprocal forbearance and where there is an immediate common interest we may safely count upon its operation when the particular debts of the states are done away and their expenses come to be limited within their natural compass the possibility almost of interference will vanish a small land tax will answer the purpose of the states and will be their most simple and most fit resource,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , , O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> many spectres have been raised out of this power of internal taxation to excite the apprehensions of the people double sets of revenue officers a duplication of their burdens by double taxations and the frightful forms of odious and oppressive poll-taxes have been played off with all the ingenious dexterity of political legerdemain,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O : O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as to the first point there are two cases in which there can be no room for double sets of officers one where the right of imposing the tax is exclusively vested in the union which applies to the duties on imports the other where the object has not fallen under any state regulation or provision which may be applicable to a variety of objects in other cases the probability is that the united states will either wholly abstain from the objects preoccupied for local purposes or will make use of the state officers and state regulations for collecting the additional imposition this will best answer the views of revenue because it will save expense in the collection and will best avoid any occasion of disgust to the state governments and to the people at all events here is a practicable expedient for avoiding such an inconvenience and nothing more can be required than to show that evils predicted to not necessarily result from the plan,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as to any argument derived from a supposed system of influence it is a sufficient answer to say that it ought not to be presumed but the supposition is susceptible of a more precise answer if such a spirit should infest the councils of the union the most certain road to the accomplishment of its aim would be to employ the state officers as much as possible and to attach them to the union by an accumulation of their emoluments this would serve to turn the tide of state influence into the channels of the national government instead of making federal influence flow in an opposite and adverse current but all suppositions of this kind are invidious and ought to be banished from the consideration of the great question before the people they can answer no other end than to cast a mist over the truth,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as to the suggestion of double taxation the answer is plain the wants of the union are to be supplied in one way or another if to be done by the authority of the federal government it will not be to be done by that of the state government the quantity of taxes to be paid by the community must be the same in either case with this advantage if the provision is to be made by the union that the capital resource of commercial imposts which is the most convenient branch of revenue can be prudently improved to a much greater extent under federal than under state regulation and of course will render it less necessary to recur to more inconvenient methods and with this further advantage that as far as there may be any real difficulty in the exercise of the power of internal taxation it will impose a disposition to greater care in the choice and arrangement of the means and must naturally tend to make it a fixed point of policy in the national administration to go as far as may be practicable in making the luxury of the rich tributary to the public treasury in order to diminish the necessity of those impositions which might create dissatisfaction in the poorer and most numerous classes of the society happy it is when the interest which the government has in the preservation of its own power coincides with a proper distribution of the public burdens and tends to guard the least wealthy part of the community from oppression,"O O O O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as to poll taxes i without scruple confess my disapprobation of them and though they have prevailed from an early period in those states1 which have uniformly been the most tenacious of their rights i should lament to see them introduced into practice under the national government but does it follow because there is a power to lay them that they will actually be laid every state in the union has power to impose taxes of this kind and yet in several of them they are unknown in practice are the state governments to be stigmatized as tyrannies because they possess this power if they are not with what propriety can the like power justify such a charge against the national government or even be urged as an obstacle to its adoption as little friendly as i am to the species of imposition i still feel a thorough conviction that the power of having recourse to it ought to exist in the federal government there are certain emergencies of nations in which expedients that in the ordinary state of things ought to be forborne become essential to the public weal and the government from the possibility of such emergencies ought ever to have the option of making use of them the real scarcity of objects in this country which may be considered as productive sources of revenue is a reason peculiar to itself for not abridging the discretion of the national councils in this respect there may exist certain critical and tempestuous conjunctures of the state in which a poll tax may become an inestimable resource and as i know nothing to exempt this portion of the globe from the common calamities that have befallen other parts of it i acknowledge my aversion to every project that is calculated to disarm the government of a single weapon which in any possible contingency might be usefully employed for the general defense and security,"O O O O , , O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i have now gone through the examination of such of the powers proposed to be vested in the united states which may be considered as having an immediate relation to the energy of the government and have endeavored to answer the principal objections which have been made to them i have passed over in silence those minor authorities which are either too inconsiderable to have been thought worthy of the hostilities of the opponents of the constitution or of too manifest propriety to admit of controversy the mass of judiciary power however might have claimed an investigation under this head had it not been for the consideration that its organization and its extent may be more advantageously considered in connection this has determined me to refer it to the branch of our inquiries upon which we shall next enter,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president is `` to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the constitution but the congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone or in the courts of law or in the heads of departments the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies which may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session '',"O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it has been observed in a former paper that `` the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration '' if the justness of this observation be admitted the mode of appointing the officers of the united states contained in the foregoing clauses must when examined be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation it is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the union and it will not need proof that on this point must essentially depend the character of its administration,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it will be agreed on all hands that the power of appointment in ordinary cases ought to be modified in one of three ways it ought either to be vested in a single man or in a select assembly of a moderate number or in a single man with the concurrence of such an assembly the exercise of it by the people at large will be readily admitted to be impracticable as waiving every other consideration it would leave them little time to do anything else when therefore mention is made in the subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of men what is said must be understood to relate to a select body or assembly of the description already given the people collectively from their number and from their dispersed situation can not be regulated in their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and intrigue which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men,"O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> those who have themselves reflected upon the subject or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of these papers in relation to the appointment of the president will i presume agree to the position that there would always be great probability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities at least respectable premising this i proceed to lay it down as a rule that one man of discernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices than a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior discernment,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> the sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation he will on this account feel himself under stronger obligations and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest pretensions to them he will have fewer personal attachments to gratify than a body of men who may each be supposed to have an equal number and will be so much the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of affection a single well-directed man by a single understanding can not be distracted and warped by that diversity of views feelings and interests which frequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body there is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether they relate to ourselves or to others who are to be the objects of our choice or preference hence in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices by an assembly of men we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes partialities and antipathies attachments and animosities which are felt by those who compose the assembly the choice which may at any time happen to be made under such circumstances will of course be the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other or of a compromise between the parties in either case the intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight in the first the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party will be more considered than those which fit the person for the station in the last the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent `` give us the man we wish for this office and you shall have the one you wish for that '' this will be the usual condition of the bargain and it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision made in this respect by the convention they contend that the president ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments under the federal government but it is easy to show that every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would in substance be derived from the power of nomination which is proposed to be conferred upon him while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided in the act of nomination his judgment alone would be exercised and as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who with the approbation of the senate should fill an office his responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment there can in this view be no difference others who are to be the objects of our choice or preference hence in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices by an assembly of men we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes partialities and antipathies attachments and animosities which are felt by those who compose the assembly the choice which may at any time happen to be made under such circumstances will of course be the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other or of a compromise between the parties in either case the intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight in the first the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party will be more considered than those which fit the person for the station in the last the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent `` give us the man we wish for this office and you shall have the one you wish for that '' this will be the usual condition of the bargain and it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negotiations,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O .

<bos> but might not his nomination be overruled i grant it might yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself the person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference though perhaps not in the first degree it is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled the senate could not be tempted by the preference they might feel to another to reject the one proposed because they could not assure themselves that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination they could not even be certain that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal,"O O O O O O O ?

<bos> to what purpose then require the co-operation of the senate i answer that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful though in general a silent operation it would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the president and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state prejudice from family connection from personal attachment or from a view to popularity in addition to this it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration,"O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> it will readily be comprehended that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body and that body an entier branch of the legislature the possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing the danger to his own reputation and in the case of an elective magistrate to his political existence from betraying a spirit of favoritism or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other he would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward for the most distinguished or lucrative stations candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same state to which he particularly belonged or of being in some way or other personally allied to him or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to this reasoning it has been objected that the president by the influence of the power of nomination may secure the complaisance of the senate to his views this supposition of universal venalty in human nature is little less an error in political reasoning than the supposition of universal rectitude the institution of delegated power implies that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind which may be a reasonable foundation of confidence and experience justifies the theory it has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most corrupt governments the venalty of the british house of commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body in the country to which they belong as well as in this and it can not be doubted that the charge is to a considerable extent well founded but it is as little to be doubted that there is always a large proportion of the body which consists of independent and public-spirited men who have an influential weight in the councils of the nation hence it is the present reign not excepted that the sense of that body is often seen to control the inclinations of the monarch both with regard to men and to measures though it might therefore be allowable to suppose that the executive might occasionally influence some individuals in the senate yet the supposition that he could in general purchase the integrity of the whole body would be forced and improbable a man disposed to view human nature as it is without either flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices will see sufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the senate to rest satisfied not only that it will be impracticable to the executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of its members but that the necessity of its co-operation in the business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate nor is the integrity of the senate the only reliance the constitution has provided some important guards against the danger of executive influence upon the legislative body it declares that `` no senator or representative shall during the time for which he was elected be appointed to any civil office under the united states which shall have been created or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time and no person holding any office under the united states shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office '',"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> according to the formal division of the subject of these papers announced in my first number there would appear still to remain for discussion two points `` the analogy of the proposed government to your own state constitution '' and `` the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government to liberty and to property '' but these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat in a more dilated form what has been heretofore said which the advanced stage of the question and the time already spent upon it conspire to forbid,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O .

<bos> it is remarkable that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which organizes the government of this state holds not less with regard to many of the supposed defects than to the real excellences of the former among the pretended defects are the re-eligibility of the executive the want of a council the omission of a formal bill of rights the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press these and several others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing constitution of this state as on the one proposed for the union and a man must have slender pretensions to consistency who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live than the fury with which they have attacked that plan for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the additional securities to republican government to liberty and to property to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the union will impose on local factions and insurrections and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single states who may acquire credit and influence enough from leaders and favorites to become the despots of the people in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue which the dissolution of the confederacy would invite and facilitate in the prevention of extensive military establishments which could not fail to grow out of wars between the states in a disunited situation in the express guaranty of a republican form of government to each in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the state governments which have undermined the foundations of property and credit have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals,"O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."

<bos> let us now pause and ask ourselves whether in the course of these papers the proposed constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation and necessary to the public safety and prosperity every man is bound to answer these questions to himself according to the best of his conscience and understanding and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates of his judgment this is a duty from which nothing can give him a dispensation 't is one that he is called upon nay constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society to discharge sincerely and honestly no partial motive no particular interest no pride of opinion no temporary passion or prejudice will justify to himself to his country or to his posterity an improper election of the part he is to act let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community but the very existence of the nation and let him remember that a majority of america has already given its sanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> concessions on the part of the friends of the plan that it has not a claim to absolute perfection have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies `` why '' say they `` should we adopt an imperfect thing why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established '' this may be plausible enough but it is only plausible in the first place i remark that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated they have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective and that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community can not be safely confided to it this as far as i have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions is an entire perversion of their sense no advocate of the measure can be found who will not declare as his sentiment that the system though it may not be perfect in every part is upon the whole a good one is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i answer in the next place that i should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs and to expose the union to the jeopardy of successive experiments in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan i never expect to see a perfect work from imperfect man the result of the deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a compound as well of the errors and prejudices as of the good sense and wisdom of the individuals of whom they are composed the compacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct states in a common bond of amity and union must as necessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations how can perfection spring from such materials,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

"<bos> the reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published in this city,1 are unanswerable to show the utter improbability of assembling a new convention under circumstances in any degree so favorable to a happy issue as those in which the late convention met deliberated and concluded i will not repeat the arguments there used as i presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation it is certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country there is however one point of light in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view i can not resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this aspect","O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O .

<bos> it appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the constitution the moment an alteration is made in the present plan it becomes to the purpose of adoption a new one and must undergo a new decision of each state to its complete establishment throughout the union it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen states if on the contrary the constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the states as it stands alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine states here then the chances are as thirteen to nine2 in favor of subsequent amendment rather than of the original adoption of an entire system,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this is not all every constitution for the united states must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars in which thirteen independent states are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest we may of course expect to see in any body of men charged with its original formation very different combinations of the parts upon different points many of those who form a majority on one question may become the minority on a second and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact and hence also an immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act the degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties,"O O O O .

<bos> but every amendment to the constitution if once established would be a single proposition and might be brought forward singly there would then be no necessity for management or compromise in relation to any other point no giving nor taking the will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue and consequently whenever nine or rather ten states were united in the desire of a particular amendment that amendment must infallibly take place there can therefore be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment and that of establishing in the first instance a complete constitution,"O O O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> in opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments it has been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national government will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed for my own part i acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may upon mature consideration be thought useful will be applicable to the organization of the government not to the mass of its powers and on this account alone i think there is no weight in the observation just stated i also think there is little weight in it on another account the intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen states at any rate independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity will in my opinion constantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their constituents but there is yet a further consideration which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt that the observation is futile it is this that the national rulers whenever nine states concur will have no option upon the subject by the fifth article of the plan the congres will be obliged `` on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states õwhich at present amount to nineå to call a convention for proposing amendments which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the states or by conventions in three fourths thereof '' the words of this article are peremptory the congress `` shall call a convention '' nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body and of consequence all the declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes in air nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or three fourths of the state legislatures in amendments which may affect local interests can there be any room to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the general liberty or security of the people we may safely rely on the disposition of the state legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if the foregoing argument is a fallacy certain it is that i am myself deceived by it for it is in my conception one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration those who see the matter in the same light with me however zealous they may be for amendments must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption as the most direct road to their own object,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the zeal for attempts to amend prior to the establishment of the constitution must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and ingenious `` to balance a large state or society õsays heå whether monarchical or republican on general laws is a work of so great difficulty that no human genius however comprehensive is able by the mere dint of reason and reflection to effect it the judgments of many must unite in the work experience must guide their labor time must bring it to perfection and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into in their first trials and experiments `` 3 these judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy civil war a perpetual alienation of the states from each other and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain but from time and experience it may be in me a defect of political fortitude but i acknowledge that i can not entertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary a nation without a national government is in my view an awful spectacle the establishment of a constitution in time of profound peace by the voluntary consent of a whole people is a prodigy to the completion of which i look forward with trembling anxiety i can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have in so arduous an enterprise upon seven out of the thirteen states and after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground to recommence the course i dread the more the consequences of new attempts because i know that powerful individuals in this and in other states are enemies to a general national government in every possible shape,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> the want of a power to regulate commerce is by all parties allowed to be of the number the utility of such a power has been anticipated under the first head of our inquiries and for this reason as well as from the universal conviction entertained upon the subject little need be added in this place it is indeed evident on the most superficial view that there is no object either as it respects the interests of trade or finance that more strongly demands a federal superintendence the want of it has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the states no nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the united states by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the union might at any moment be violated by its members and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets without granting us any return but such as their momentary convenience might suggest it is not therefore to be wondered at that mr. jenkinson in ushering into the house of commons a bill for regulating the temporary intercourse between the two countries should preface its introduction by a declaration that similar provisions in former bills had been found to answer every purpose to the commerce of great britain and that it would be prudent to persist in the plan until it should appear whether the american government was likely or not to acquire greater consistency.1,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> several states have endeavored by separate prohibitions restrictions and exclusions to influence the conduct of that kingdom in this particular but the want of concert arising from the want of a general authority and from clashing and dissimilar views in the state has hitherto frustrated every experiment of the kind and will continue to do so as long as the same obstacles to a uniformity of measures continue to exist,"O O O O , O O , , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the interfering and unneighborly regulations of some states contrary to the true spirit of the union have in different instances given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others and it is to be feared that examples of this nature if not restrained by a national control would be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than injurious impediments to the intercourse between the different parts of the confederacy `` the commerce of the german empire2 is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing through their territories by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which germany is so happily watered are rendered almost useless '' though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this description to be strictly applicable to us yet we may reasonably expect from the gradual conflicts of state regulations that the citizens of each would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the power of raising armies by the most obvious construction of the articles of the confederation is merely a power of making requisitions upon the states for quotas of men this practice in the course of the late war was found replete with obstructions to a vigorous and to an economical system of defense it gave birth to a competition between the states which created a kind of auction for men in order to furnish the quotas required of them they outbid each other till bounties grew to an enormous and insupportable size the hope of a still further increase afforded an inducement to those who were disposed to serve to procrastinate their enlistment and disinclined them from engaging for any considerable periods hence slow and scanty levies of men in the most critical emergencies of our affairs short enlistments at an unparalleled expense continual fluctuations in the troops ruinous to their discipline and subjecting the public safety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbanded army hence also those oppressive expedients for raising men which were upon several occasions practiced and which nothing but the enthusiasm of liberty would have induced the people to endure,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this method of raising troops is not more unfriendly to economy and vigor than it is to an equal distribution of the burden the states near the seat of war influenced by motives of self-preservation made efforts to furnish their quotas which even exceeded their abilities while those at a distance from danger were for the most part as remiss as the others were diligent in their exertions the immediate pressure of this inequality was not in this case as in that of the contributions of money alleviated by the hope of a final liquidation the states which did not pay their proportions of money might at least be charged with their deficiencies but no account could be formed of the deficiencies in the supplies of men we shall not however see much reason to reget the want of this hope when we consider how little prospect there is that the most delinquent states will ever be able to make compensation for their pecuniary failures the system of quotas and requisitions whether it be applied to men or money is in every view a system of imbecility in the union and of inequality and injustice among the members,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the right of equal suffrage among the states is another exceptionable part of the confederation every idea of proportion and every rule of fair representation conspire to condemn a principle which gives to rhode island an equal weight in the scale of power with massachusetts or connecticut or new york and to deleware an equal voice in the national deliberations with pennsylvania or virginia or north carolina its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail sophistry may reply that sovereigns are equal and that a majority of the votes of the states will be a majority of confederated america but this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense it may happen that this majority of states is a small minority of the people of america3 and two thirds of the people of america could not long be persuaded upon the credit of artificial distinctions and syllogistic subtleties to submit their interests to the management and disposal of one third the larger states would after a while revolt from the idea of receiving the law from the smaller to acquiesce in such a privation of their due importance in the political scale would be not merely to be insensible to the love of power but even to sacrifice the desire of equality it is neither rational to expect the first nor just to require the last the smaller states considering how peculiarly their safety and welfare depend on union ought readily to renounce a pretension which if not relinquished would prove fatal to its duration,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may be objected to this that not seven but nine states or two thirds of the whole number must consent to the most important resolutions and it may be thence inferred that nine states would always comprehend a majority of the union but this does not obviate the impropriety of an equal vote between states of the most unequal dimensions and populousness nor is the inference accurate in point of fact for we can enumerate nine states which contain less than a majority of the people4 and it is constitutionally possible that these nine may give the vote besides there are matters of considerable moment determinable by a bare majority and there are others concerning which doubts have been entertained which if interpreted in favor of the sufficiency of a vote of seven states would extend its operation to interests of the first magnitude in addition to this it is to be observed that there is a probability of an increase in the number of states and no provision for a proportional augmentation of the ratio of votes,"O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but this is not all what at first sight may seem a remedy is in reality a poison to give a minority a negative upon the majority which is always the case where more than a majority is requisite to a decision is in its tendency to subject the sense of the greater number to that of the lesser congress from the nonattendance of a few states have been frequently in the situation of a polish diet where a single vote has been sufficient to put a stop to all their movements a sixtieth part of the union which is about the proportion of delaware and rhode island has several times been able to oppose an entire bar to its operations this is one of those refinements which in practice has an effect the reverse of what is expected from it in theory the necessity of unanimity in public bodies or of something approaching towards it has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security but its real operation is to embarrass the administration to destroy the energy of the government and to substitute the pleasure caprice or artifices of an insignificant turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority in those emergencies of a nation in which the goodness or badness the weakness or strength of its government is of the greatest importance there is commonly a necessity for action the public business must in some way or other go forward if a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority respecting the best mode of conducting it the majority in order that something may be done must conform to the views of the minority and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater and give a tone to the national proceedings hence tedious delays continual negotiation and intrigue contemptible compromises of the public good and yet in such a system it is even happy when such compromises can take place for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended or fatally defeated it is often by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes kept in a state of inaction its situation must always savor of weakness sometimes border upon anarchy,"O O O O O : O O O O O O O , , O , O .

<bos> it is not difficult to discover that a principle of this kind gives greater scope to foreign corruption as well as to domestic faction than that which permits the sense of the majority to decide though the contrary of this has been presumed the mistake has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at certain critical seasons when the concurrence of a large number is required by the constitution to the doing of any national act we are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe because nothing improper will be likely to be done but we forget how much good may be prevented and how much ill may be produced by the power of hindering the doing what may be necessary and of keeping affairs in the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at particular periods,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O .

<bos> suppose for instance we were engaged in a war in conjunction with one foreign nation against another suppose the necessity of our situation demanded peace and the interest or ambition of our ally led him to seek the prosecution of the war with views that might justify us in making separate terms in such a state of things this ally of ours would evidently find it much easier by his bribes and intrigues to tie up the hands of government from making peace where two thirds of all the votes were requisite to that object than where a simple majority would suffice in the first case he would have to corrupt a smaller number in the last a greater number upon the same principle it would be much easier for a foreign power with which we were at war to perplex our councils and embarrass our exertions and in a commercial view we may be subjected to similar inconveniences a nation with which we might have a treaty of commerce could with much greater facility prevent our forming a connection with her competitor in trade though such a connection should be ever so beneficial to ourselves,"O , O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O .

<bos> evils of this description ought not to be regarded as imaginary one of the weak sides of republics among their numerous advantages is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption an hereditary monarch though often disposed to sacrifice his subjects to his ambition has so great a personal interest in the government and in the external glory of the nation that it is not easy for a foreign power to give him an equivalent for what he would sacrifice by treachery to the state the world has accordingly been witness to few examples of this species of royal prostitution though there have been abundant specimens of every other kind,"O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in republics persons elevated from the mass of the community by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens to stations of great pre-eminence and power may find compensations for betraying their trust which to any but minds animated and guided by superior virtue may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock and to overbalance the obligations of duty hence it is that history furnishes us with so many mortifying examples of the prevalency of foreign corruption in republican governments how much this contributed to the ruin of the ancient commonwealths has been already delineated it is well known that the deputies of the united provinces have in various instances been purchased by the emissaries of the neighboring kingdoms the earl of chesterfield if my memory serves me right in a letter to his court intimates that his success in an important negotiation must depend on his obtaining a major 's commission for one of those deputies and in sweden the parties were alternately bought by france and england in so barefaced and notorious a manner that it excited universal disgust in the nation and was a principal cause that the most limited monarch in europe in a single day without tumult violence or opposition became one of the most absolute and uncontrolled,"O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> a circumstance which crowns the defects of the confederation remains yet to be mentioned the want of a judiciary power laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation the treaties of the united states to have any force at all must be considered as part of the law of the land their true import as far as respects individuals must like all other laws be ascertained by judicial determinations to produce uniformity in these determinations they ought to be submitted in the last resort to one supreme tribunal and this tribunal ought to be instituted under the same authority which forms the treaties themselves these ingredients are both indispensable if there is in each state a court of final jurisdiction there may be as many different final determinations on the same point as there are courts there are endless diversities in the opinions of men we often see not only different courts but the judges of the came court differing from each other to avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory decisions of a number of independent judicatories all nations have found it necessary to establish one court paramount to the rest possessing a general superintendence and authorized to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil justice,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> this is the more necessary where the frame of the government is so compounded that the laws of the whole are in danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts in this case if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate jurisdiction besides the contradictions to be expected from difference of opinion there will be much to fear from the bias of local views and prejudices and from the interference of local regulations as often as such an interference was to happen there would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws for nothing is more natural to men in office than to look with peculiar deference towards that authority to which they owe their official existence the treaties of the united states under the present constitution are liable to the infractions of thirteen different legislatures and as many different courts of final jurisdiction acting under the authority of those legislatures the faith the reputation the peace of the whole union are thus continually at the mercy of the prejudices the passions and the interests of every member of which it is composed is it possible that foreign nations can either respect or confide in such a government is it possible that the people of america will longer consent to trust their honor their happiness their safety on so precarious a foundation,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in this review of the confederation i have confined myself to the exhibition of its most material defects passing over those imperfections in its details by which even a great part of the power intended to be conferred upon it has been in a great measure rendered abortive it must be by this time evident to all men of reflection who can divest themselves of the prepossessions of preconceived opinions that it is a system so radically vicious and unsound as to admit not of amendment but by an entire change in its leading features and characters,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the organization of congress is itself utterly improper for the exercise of those powers which are necessary to be deposited in the union a single assembly may be a proper receptacle of those slender or rather fettered authorities which have been heretofore delegated to the federal head but it would be inconsistent with all the principles of good government to intrust it with those additional powers which even the moderate and more rational adversaries of the proposed constitution admit ought to reside in the united states if that plan should not be adopted and if the necessity of the union should be able to withstand the ambitious aims of those men who may indulge magnificent schemes of personal aggrandizement from its dissolution the probability would be that we should run into the project of conferring supplementary powers upon congress as they are now constituted and either the machine from the intrinsic feebleness of its structure will moulder into pieces in spite of our ill-judged efforts to prop it or by successive augmentations of its force an energy as necessity might prompt we shall finally accumulate in a single body all the most important prerogatives of sovereignty and thus entail upon our posterity one of the most execrable forms of government that human infatuation ever contrived thus we should create in reality that very tyranny which the adversaries of the new constitution either are or affect to be solicitous to avert,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it has not a little contributed to the infirmities of the existing federal system that it never had a ratification by the people resting on no better foundation than the consent of the several legislatures it has been exposed to frequent and intricate questions concerning the validity of its powers and has in some instances given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legislative repeal owing its ratification to the law of a state it has been contended that the same authority might repeal the law by which it was ratified however gross a heresy it may be to maintain that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that compact the doctrine itself has had respectable advocates the possibility of a question of this nature proves the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated authority the fabric of american empire ought to rest on the solid basis of the consent of the people the streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure original fountain of all legitimate authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> having in the three last numbers taken a summary review of the principal circumstances and events which have depicted the genius and fate of other confederate governments i shall now proceed in the enumeration of the most important of those defects which have hitherto disappointed our hopes from the system established among ourselves to form a safe and satisfactory judgment of the proper remedy it is absolutely necessary that we should be well acquainted with the extent and malignity of the disease,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the next most palpable defect of the subsisting confederation is the total want of a sanction to its laws the united states as now composed have no powers to exact obedience or punish disobedience to their resolutions either by pecuniary mulcts by a suspension or divestiture of privileges or by any other constitutional mode there is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against delinquent members and if such a right should be ascribed to the federal head as resulting from the nature of the social compact between the states it must be by inference and construction in the face of that part of the second article by which it is declared `` that each state shall retain every power jurisdiction and right not expressly delegated to the united states in congress assembled '' there is doubtless a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist but we are reduced to the dilemma either of embracing that supposition preposterous as it may seem or of contravening or explaining away a provision which has been of late a repeated theme of the eulogies of those who oppose the new constitution and the want of which in that plan has been the subject of much plausible animadversion and severe criticism if we are unwilling to impair the force of this applauded provision we shall be obliged to conclude that the united states afford the extraordinary spectacle of a government destitute even of the shadow of constitutional power to enforce the execution of its own laws it will appear from the specimens which have been cited that the american confederacy in this particular stands discriminated from every other institution of a similar kind and exhibits a new and unexampled phenomenon in the political world,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the want of a mutual guaranty of the state governments is another capital imperfection in the federal plan there is nothing of this kind declared in the articles that compose it and to imply a tacit guaranty from considerations of utility would be a still more flagrant departure from the clause which has been mentioned than to imply a tacit power of coercion from the like considerations the want of a guaranty though it might in its consequences endanger the union does not so immediately attack its existence as the want of a constitutional sanction to its laws,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> without a guaranty the assistance to be derived from the union in repelling those domestic dangers which may sometimes threaten the existence of the state constitutions must be renounced usurpation may rear its crest in each state and trample upon the liberties of the people while the national government could legally do nothing more than behold its encroachments with indignation and regret a successful faction may erect a tyranny on the ruins of order and law while no succor could constitutionally be afforded by the union to the friends and supporters of the government the tempestuous situation from which massachusetts has scarcely emerged evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative who can determine what might have been the issue of her late convulsions if the malcontents had been headed by a caesar or by a cromwell who can predict what effect a despotism established in massachusetts would have upon the liberties of new hampshire or rhode island of connecticut or new york,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> the inordinate pride of state importance has suggested to some minds an objection to the principle of a guaranty in the federal government as involving an officious interference in the domestic concerns of the members a scruple of this kind would deprive us of one of the principal advantages to be expected from union and can only flow from a misapprehension of the nature of the provision itself it could be no impediment to reforms of the state constitution by a majority of the people in a legal and peaceable mode this right would remain undiminished the guaranty could only operate against changes to be effected by violence towards the preventions of calamities of this kind too many checks can not be provided the peace of society and the stability of government depend absolutely on the efficacy of the precautions adopted on this head where the whole power of the government is in the hands of the people there is the less pretense for the use of violent remedies in partial or occasional distempers of the state the natural cure for an ill-administration in a popular or representative constitution is a change of men a guaranty by the national authority would be as much levelled against the usurpations of rulers as against the ferments and outrages of faction and sedition in the community,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the principle of regulating the contributions of the states to the common treasury by quotas is another fundamental error in the confederation its repugnancy to an adequate supply of the national exigencies has been already pointed out and has sufficiently appeared from the trial which has been made of it i speak of it now solely with a view to equality among the states those who have been accustomed to contemplate the circumstances which produce and constitute national wealth must be satisfied that there is no common standard or barometer by which the degrees of it can be ascertained neither the value of lands nor the numbers of the people which have been successively proposed as the rule of state contributions has any pretension to being a just representative if we compare the wealth of the united netherlands with that of russia or germany or even of france and if we at the same time compare the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of that contracted district with the total value of the lands and the aggregate population of the immense regions of either of the three last-mentioned countries we shall at once discover that there is no comparison between the proportion of either of these two objects and that of the relative wealth of those nations if the like parallel were to be run between several of the american states it would furnish a like result let virginia be contrasted with north carolina pennsylvania with connecticut or maryland with new jersey and we shall be convinced that the respective abilities of those states in relation to revenue bear little or no analogy to their comparative stock in lands or to their comparative population the position may be equally illustrated by a similar process between the counties of the same state no man who is acquainted with the state of new york will doubt that the active wealth of king 's county bears a much greater proportion to that of montgomery than it would appear to be if we should take either the total value of the lands or the total number of the people as a criterion,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the wealth of nations depends upon an infinite variety of causes situation soil climate the nature of the productions the nature of the government the genius of the citizens the degree of information they possess the state of commerce of arts of industry these circumstances and many more too complex minute or adventitious to admit of a particular specification occasion differences hardly conceivable in the relative opulence and riches of different countries the consequence clearly is that there can be no common measure of national wealth and of course no general or stationary rule by which the ability of a state to pay taxes can be determined the attempt therefore to regulate the contributions of the members of a confederacy by any such rule can not fail to be productive of glaring inequality and extreme oppression,"O O O O O O O O O O O . , , , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O , O O O , O , O , O O O O , O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this inequality would of itself be sufficient in america to work the eventual destruction of the union if any mode of enforcing a compliance with its requisitions could be devised the suffering states would not long consent to remain associated upon a principle which distributes the public burdens with so unequal a hand and which was calculated to impoverish and oppress the citizens of some states while those of others would scarcely be conscious of the small proportion of the weight they were required to sustain this however is an evil inseparable from the principle of quotas and requisitions,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there is no method of steering clear of this inconvenience but by authorizing the national government to raise its own revenues in its own way imposts excises and in general all duties upon articles of consumption may be compared to a fluid which will in time find its level with the means of paying them the amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option and can be regulated by an attention to his resources the rich may be extravagant the poor can be frugal and private oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects proper for such impositions if inequalities should arise in some states from duties on particular objects these will in all probability be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other states from the duties on other objects in the course of time and things an equilibrium as far as it is attainable in so complicated a subject will be established everywhere or if inequalities should still exist they would neither be so great in their degree so uniform in their operation nor so odious in their appearance as those which would necessarily spring from quotas upon any scale that can possibly be devised,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , , , O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption that they contain in their own nature a security against excess they prescribe their own limit which can not be exceeded without defeating the end proposed that is an extension of the revenue when applied to this object the saying is as just as it is witty that `` in political arithmetic two and two do not always make four '' if duties are too high they lessen the consumption the collection is eluded and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds this forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of this class and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing them,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes and must for a long time constitute the chief part of the revenue raised in this country those of the direct kind which principally relate to land and buildings may admit of a rule of apportionment either the value of land or the number of the people may serve as a standard the state of agriculture and the populousness of a country have been considered as nearly connected with each other and as a rule for the purpose intended numbers in the view of simplicity and certainty are entitled to a preference in every country it is a herculean task to obtain a valuation of the land in a country imperfectly settled and progressive in improvement the difficulties are increased almost to impracticability the expense of an accurate valuation is in all situations a formidable objection in a branch of taxation where no limits to the discretion of the government are to be found in the nature of things the establishment of a fixed rule not incompatible with the end may be attended with fewer inconveniences than to leave that discretion altogether at large,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it has been already observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of providing for the support of the national forces in which proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising troops of building and equipping fleets and all other expenses in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations but these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of the union in respect to revenue must necessarily be empowered to extend it must embrace a provision for the support of the national civil list for the payment of the national debts contracted or that may be contracted and in general for all those matters which will call for disbursements out of the national treasury the conclusion is that there must be interwoven in the frame of the government a general power of taxation in one shape or another,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the ottoman or turkish empire the sovereign though in other respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects has no right to impose a new tax the consequence is that he permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage the people without mercy and in turn squeezes out of them the sums of which he stands in need to satisfy his own exigencies and those of the state in america from a like cause the government of the union has gradually dwindled into a state of decay approaching nearly to annihilation who can doubt that the happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by competent authorities in the proper hands to provide the revenues which the necessities of the public might require,"O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the present confederation feeble as it is intended to repose in the united states an unlimited power of providing for the pecuniary wants of the union but proceeding upon an erroneous principle it has been done in such a manner as entirely to have frustrated the intention congress by the articles which compose that compact as has already been stated are authorized to ascertain and call for any sums of money necessary in their judgment to the service of the united states and their requisitions if conformable to the rule of apportionment are in every constitutional sense obligatory upon the states these have no right to question the propriety of the demand no discretion beyond that of devising the ways and means of furnishing the sums demanded but though this be strictly and truly the case though the assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the articles of union though it may seldom or never have been avowedly claimed yet in practice it has been constantly exercised and would continue to be so as long as the revenues of the confederacy should remain dependent on the intermediate agency of its members what the consequences of this system have been is within the knowledge of every man the least conversant in our public affairs and has been amply unfolded in different parts of these inquiries it is this which has chiefly contributed to reduce us to a situation which affords ample cause both of mortification to ourselves and of triumph to our enemies,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> what remedy can there be for this situation but in a change of the system which has produced it in a change of the fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions what substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance but that of permitting the national government to raise its own revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every well-ordered constitution of civil government ingenious men may declaim with plausibility on any subject but no human ingenuity can point out any other expedient to rescue us from the inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from defective supplies of the public treasury,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> the more intelligent adversaries of the new constitution admit the force of this reasoning but they qualify their admission by a distinction between what they call internal and external taxation the former they would reserve to the state governments the latter which they explain into commercial imposts or rather duties on imported articles they declare themselves willing to concede to the federal head this distinction however would violate the maxim of good sense and sound policy which dictates that every power ought to be in proportion to its object and would still leave the general government in a kind of tutelage to the state governments inconsistent with every idea of vigor or efficiency who can pretend that commercial imposts are or would be alone equal to the present and future exigencies of the union taking into the account the existing debt foreign and domestic upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed with the importance of public justice and public credit could approve in addition to the establishments which all parties will acknowledge to be necessary we could not reasonably flatter ourselves that this resource alone upon the most improved scale would even suffice for its present necessities its future necessities admit not of calculation or limitation and upon the principle more than once adverted to the power of making provision for them as they arise ought to be equally unconfined i believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history of mankind that in the usual progress of things the necessities of a nation in every stage of its existence will be found at least equal to its resources,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to say that deficiencies may be provided for by requisitions upon the states is on the one hand to acknowledge that this system can not be depended upon and on the other hand to depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit those who have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have been exhibited by experience or delineated in the course of these papers must feel invincible repugnancy to trusting the national interests in any degree to its operation its inevitable tendency whenever it is brought into activity must be to enfeeble the union and sow the seeds of discord and contention between the federal head and its members and between the members themselves can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better supplied in this mode than the total wants of the union have heretofore been supplied in the same mode it ought to be recollected that if less will be required from the states they will have proportionably less means to answer the demand if the opinions of those who contend for the distinction which has been mentioned were to be received as evidence of truth one would be led to conclude that there was some known point in the economy of national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to say thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by supplying the wants of government and all beyond this is unworthy of our care or anxiety how is it possible that a government half supplied and always necessitous can fulfill the purposes of its institution can provide for the security advance the prosperity or support the reputation of the commonwealth how can it ever possess either energy or stability dignity or credit confidence at home or respectability abroad how can its administration be any thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing impotent disgraceful how will it be able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagements to immediate necessity how can it undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> let us attend to what would be the effects of this situation in the very first war in which we should happen to be engaged we will presume for argument 's sake that the revenue arising from the impost duties answers the purposes of a provision for the public debt and of a peace establishment for the union thus circumstanced a war breaks out what would be the probable conduct of the government in such an emergency taught by experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the success of requisitions unable by its own authority to lay hold of fresh resources and urged by considerations of national danger would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the defense of the state it is not easy to see how a step of this kind could be avoided and if it should be taken it is evident that it would prove the destruction of public credit at the very moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety to imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with would be the extreme of infatuation in the modern system of war nations the most wealthy are obliged to have recourse to large loans a country so little opulent as ours must feel this necessity in a much stronger degree but who would lend to a government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the steadiness of its measures for paying the loans it might be able to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in their conditions they would be made upon the same principles that usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors with a sparing hand and at enormous premiums,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may perhaps be imagined that from the scantiness of the resources of the country the necessity of diverting the established funds in the case supposed would exist though the national government should possess an unrestrained power of taxation but two considerations will serve to quiet all apprehension on this head one is that we are sure the resources of the community in their full extent will be brought into activity for the benefit of the union the other is that whatever deficiences there may be can without difficulty be supplied by loans,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the power of creating new funds upon new objects of taxation by its own authority would enable the national government to borrow as far as its necessities might require foreigners as well as the citizens of america could then reasonably repose confidence in its engagements but to depend upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen other governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts when once its situation is clearly understood would require a degree of credulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary transactions of mankind and little reconcilable with the usual sharp-sightedness of avarice,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with men who hope to see realized in america the halcyon scenes of the poetic or fabulous age but to those who believe we are likely to experience a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities which have fallen to the lot of other nations they must appear entitled to serious attention such men must behold the actual situation of their country with painful solicitude and deprecate the evils which ambition or revenge might with too much facility inflict upon it,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> i proceed now to trace the real characters of the proposed executive as they are marked out in the plan of the convention this will serve to place in a strong light the unfairness of the representations which have been made in regard to it,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the first thing which strikes our attention is that the executive authority with few exceptions is to be vested in a single magistrate this will scarcely however be considered as a point upon which any comparison can be grounded for if in this particular there be a resemblance to the king of great britain there is not less a resemblance to the grand seignior to the khan of tartary to the man of the seven mountains or to the governor of new york,"O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> that magistrate is to be elected for four years and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the united states shall think him worthy of their confidence in these circumstances there is a total dissimilitude between him and a king of great britain who is an hereditary monarch possessing the crown as a patrimony descendible to his heirs forever but there is a close analogy between him and a governor of new york who is elected for three years and is re-eligible without limitation or intermission if we consider how much less time would be requisite for establishing a dangerous influence in a single state than for establishing a like influence throughout the united states we must conclude that a duration of four years for the chief magistrate of the union is a degree of permanency far less to be dreaded in that office than a duration of three years for a corresponding office in a single state,"O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president of the united states would be liable to be impeached tried and upon conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors removed from office and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law the person of the king of great britain is sacred and inviolable there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution in this delicate and important circumstance of personal responsibility the president of confederated america would stand upon no better ground than a governor of new york and upon worse ground than the governors of maryland and delaware,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , , , O O O , , O O O O O , O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president of the united states is to have power to return a bill which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature for reconsideration and the bill so returned is to become a law if upon that reconsideration it be approved by two thirds of both houses the king of great britain on his part has an absolute negative upon the acts of the two houses of parliament the disuse of that power for a considerable time past does not affect the reality of its existence and is to be ascribed wholly to the crown 's having found the means of substituting influence to authority or the art of gaining a majority in one or the other of the two houses to the necessity of exerting a prerogative which could seldom be exerted without hazarding some degree of national agitation the qualified negative of the president differs widely from this absolute negative of the british sovereign and tallies exactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision of this state of which the governor is a constituent part in this respect the power of the president would exceed that of the governor of new york because the former would possess singly what the latter shares with the chancellor and judges but it would be precisely the same with that of the governor of massachusetts whose constitution as to this article seems to have been the original from which the convention have copied,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O ; O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president is to be the `` commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states he is to have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states except in cases of impeachment to recommend to the consideration of congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient to convene on extraordinary occasions both houses of the legislature or either of them and in case of disagreement between them with respect to the time of adjournment to adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and to commission all officers of the united states '' in most of these particulars the power of the president will resemble equally that of the king of great britain and of the governor of new york the most material points of difference are these,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> first the president will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the union the king of great britain and the governor of new york have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions in this article therefore the power of the president would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor,"O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> secondly the president is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the united states in this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of great britain but in substance much inferior to it it would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces as first general and admiral of the confederacy while that of the british king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all which by the constitution under consideration would appertain to the legislature.1 the governor of new york on the other hand is by the constitution of the state vested only with the command of its militia and navy but the constitutions of several of the states expressly declare their governors to be commanders-in-chief as well of the army as navy and it may well be a question whether those of new hampshire and massachusetts in particular do not in this instance confer larger powers upon their respective governors than could be claimed by a president of the united states,"O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> thirdly the power of the president in respect to pardons would extend to all cases except those of impeachment the governor of new york may pardon in all cases even in those of impeachment except for treason and murder is not the power of the governor in this article on a calculation of political consequences greater than that of the president all conspiracies and plots against the government which have not been matured into actual treason may be screened from punishment of every kind by the interposition of the prerogative of pardoning if a governor of new york therefore should be at the head of any such conspiracy until the design had been ripened into actual hostility he could insure his accomplices and adherents an entire impunity a president of the union on the other hand though he may even pardon treason when prosecuted in the ordinary course of law could shelter no offender in any degree from the effects of impeachment and conviction would not the prospect of a total indemnity for all the preliminary steps be a greater temptation to undertake and persevere in an enterprise against the public liberty than the mere prospect of an exemption from death and confiscation if the final execution of the design upon an actual appeal to arms should miscarry would this last expectation have any influence at all when the probability was computed that the person who was to afford that exemption might himself be involved in the consequences of the measure and might be incapacitated by his agency in it from affording the desired impunity the better to judge of this matter it will be necessary to recollect that by the proposed constitution the offense of treason is limited `` to levying war upon the united states and adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort '' and that by the laws of new york it is confined within similar bounds,"O . O O O O , O O O , O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O ? O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> fourthly the president can only adjourn the national legislature in the single case of disagreement about the time of adjournment the british monarch may prorogue or even dissolve the parliament the governor of new york may also prorogue the legislature of this state for a limited time a power which in certain situations may be employed to very important purposes,"O .

<bos> the president is to have power with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur the king of great britain is the sole and absolute representative of the nation in all foreign transactions he can of his own accord make treaties of peace commerce alliance and of every other description it has been insinuated that his authority in this respect is not conclusive and that his conventions with foreign powers are subject to the revision and stand in need of the ratification of parliament but i believe this doctrine was never heard of until it was broached upon the present occasion every jurist2 of that kingdom and every other man acquainted with its constitution knows as an established fact that the prerogative of making treaties exists in the crown in its utomst plentitude and that the compacts entered into by the royal authority have the most complete legal validity and perfection independent of any other sanction the parliament it is true is sometimes seen employing itself in altering the existing laws to conform them to the stipulations in a new treaty and this may have possibly given birth to the imagination that its co-operation was necessary to the obligatory efficacy of the treaty but this parliamentary interposition proceeds from a different cause from the necessity of adjusting a most artificial and intricate system of revenue and commercial laws to the changes made in them by the operation of the treaty and of adapting new provisions and precautions to the new state of things to keep the machine from running into disorder in this respect therefore there is no comparison between the intended power of the president and the actual power of the british sovereign the one can perform alone what the other can do only with the concurrence of a branch of the legislature it must be admitted that in this instance the power of the federal executive would exceed that of any state executive but this arises naturally from the sovereign power which relates to treaties if the confederacy were to be dissolved it would become a question whether the executives of the several states were not solely invested with that delicate and important prerogative,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president is also to be authorized to receive ambassadors and other public ministers this though it has been a rich theme of declamation is more a matter of dignity than of authority it is a circumstance which will be without consequence in the administration of the government and it was far more convenient that it should be arranged in this manner than that there should be a necessity of convening the legislature or one of its branches upon every arrival of a foreign minister though it were merely to take the place of a departed predecessor,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the president is to nominate and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint ambassadors and other public ministers judges of the supreme court and in general all officers of the united states established by law and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the constitution the king of great britain is emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor he not only appoints to all offices but can create offices he can confer titles of nobility at pleasure and has the disposal of an immense number of church preferments there is evidently a great inferiority in the power of the president in this particular to that of the british king nor is it equal to that of the governor of new york if we are to interpret the meaning of the constitution of the state by the practice which has obtained under it the power of appointment is with us lodged in a council composed of the governor and four members of the senate chosen by the assembly the governor claims and has frequently exercised the right of nomination and is entitled to a casting vote in the appointment if he really has the right of nominating his authority is in this respect equal to that of the president and exceeds it in the article of the casting vote in the national government if the senate should be divided no appointment could be made in the government of new york if the council should be divided the governor can turn the scale and confirm his own nomination.3 if we compare the publicity which must necessarily attend the mode of appointment by the president and an entire branch of the national legislature with the privacy in the mode of appointment by the governor of new york closeted in a secret apartment with at most four and frequently with only two persons and if we at the same time consider how much more easy it must be to influence the small number of which a council of appointment consists than the considerable number of which the national senate would consist we can not hesitate to pronounce that the power of the chief magistrate of this state in the disposition of offices must in practice be greatly superior to that of the chief magistrate of the union,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> hence it appears that except as to the concurrent authority of the president in the article of treaties it would be difficult to determine whether that magistrate would in the aggregate possess more or less power than the governor of new york and it appears yet more unequivocally that there is no pretense for the parallel which has been attempted between him and the king of great britain but to render the contrast in this respect still more striking it may be of use to throw the principal circumstances of dissimilitude into a closer group,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president of the united states would be an officer elected by the people for four years the king of great britain is a perpetual and hereditary prince the one would be amenable to personal punishment and disgrace the person of the other is sacred and inviolable the one would have a qualified negative upon the acts of the legislative body the other has an absolute negative the one would have a right to command the military and naval forces of the nation the other in addition to this right possesses that of declaring war and of raising and regulating fleets and armies by his own authority the one would have a concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties the other is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties the one would have a like concurrent authority in appointing to offices the other is the sole author of all appointments the one can confer no privileges whatever the other can make denizens of aliens noblemen of commoners can erect corporations with all the rights incident to corporate bodies the one can prescribe no rules concerning the commerce or currency of the nation the other is in several respects the arbiter of commerce and in this capacity can establish markets and fairs can regulate weights and measures can lay embargoes for a limited time can coin money can authorize or prohibit the circulation of foreign coin the one has no particle of spiritual jurisdiction the other is the supreme head and governor of the national church what answer shall we give to those who would persuade us that things so unlike resemble each other the same that ought to be given to those who tell us that a government the whole power of which would be in the hands of the elective and periodical servants of the people is an aristocracy a monarchy and a despotism,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> these two clauses have been the source of much virulent invective and petulant declamation against the proposed constitution they have been held up to the people in all the exaggerated colors of misrepresentation as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex nor age nor high nor low nor sacred nor profane and yet strange as it may appear after all this clamor to those who may not have happened to contemplate them in the same light it may be affirmed with perfect confidence that the constitutional operation of the intended government would be precisely the same if these clauses were entirely obliterated as if they were repeated in every article they are only declaratory of a truth which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a federal government and vesting it with certain specified powers this is so clear a proposition that moderation itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so copiously vented against this part of the plan without emotions that disturb its equanimity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> what is a power but the ability or faculty of doing a thing what is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the means necessary to its execution what is a legislative power but a power of making laws what are the means to execute a legislative power but laws what is the power of laying and collecting taxes but a legislative power or a power of making laws to lay and collect taxes what are the propermeans of executing such a power but necessary and proper laws,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> this simple train of inquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which to judge of the true nature of the clause complained of it conducts us to this palpable truth that a power to lay and collect taxes must be a power to pass all laws necessary and proper for the execution of that power and what does the unfortunate and culumniated provision in question do more than declare the same truth to wit that the national legislature to whom the power of laying and collecting taxes had been previously given might in the execution of that power pass all laws necessary and proper to carry it into effect i have applied these observations thus particularly to the power of taxation because it is the immediate subject under consideration and because it is the most important of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the union but the same process will lead to the same result in relation to all other powers declared in the constitution and it is expressly to execute these powers that the sweeping clause as it has been affectedly called authorizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and proper laws if there is any thing exceptionable it must be sought for in the specific powers upon which this general declaration is predicated the declaration itself though it may be chargeable with tautology or redundancy is at least perfectly harmless,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but suspicion may ask why then was it introduced the answer is that it could only have been done for greater caution and to guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimatb authorities of the union the convention probably foresaw what it has been a principal aim of these papers to inculcate that the danger which most threatens our political welfare is that the state governments will finally sap the foundations of the union and might therefore think it necessary in so cardinal a point to leave nothing to construction whatever may have been the inducement to it the wisdom of the precaution is evident from the cry which has been raised against it as that very cry betrays a disposition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to declare,"O O O O , O O O O ?

<bos> but it may be again asked who is to judge of the necessity and propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the union i answer first that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers as upon the declaratory clause and i answer in the second place that the national government like every other must judge in the first instance of the proper exercise of its powers and its constituents in the last if the federal government should overpass the just bounds of its authority and make a tyrannical use of its powers the people whose creature it is must appeal to the standard they have formed and take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution as the exigency may suggest and prudence justify the propriety of a law in a constitutional light must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded suppose by some forced constructions of its authority which indeed can not easily be imagined the federal legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any state would it not be evident that in making such an attempt it had exceeded its jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the state suppose again that upon the pretense of an interference with its revenues it should undertake to abrogate a landtax imposed by the authority of a state would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which its constitution plainly supposes to exist in the state governments if there ever should be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be entirely due to those reasoners who in the imprudent zeal of their animosity to the plan of the convention have labored to envelop it in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> but it is said that the laws of the union are to be the supreme law of the land but what inference can be drawn from this or what would they amount to if they were not to be supreme it is evident they would amount to nothing a law by the very meaning of the term includes supremacy it is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to observe this results from every political association if individuals enter into a state of society the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct if a number of political societies enter into a larger political society the laws which the latter may enact pursuant to the powers intrusted to it by its constitution must necessarily be supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed it would otherwise be a mere treaty dependent on the good faith of the parties and not a goverment which is only another word for political power and supremacy but it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of the land these will be merely acts of usurpation and will deserve to be treated as such hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the union like the one we have just before considered only declares a truth which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal government it will not i presume have escaped observation that it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the constitution which i mention merely as an instance of caution in the convention since that limitation would have been to be understood though it had not been expressed,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> though a law therefore laying a tax for the use of the united states would be supreme in its nature and could not legally be opposed or controlled yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of the state unless upon imports and exports would not be the supreme law of the land but a usurpation of power not granted by the constitution as far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious this would be a mutual inconvenience not arising from a superiority or defect of power on either side but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the other in a manner equally disadvantageous to both it is to be hoped and presumed however that mutual interest would dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material inconvenience the inference from the whole is that the individual states would under the proposed constitution retain an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which they may stand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on imports and exports it will be shown in the next paper that this concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire subordination in respect to this branch of power of the state authority to that of the union,"O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ) O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the power of regulating the militia and of commanding its services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common defense and of watching over the internal peace of the confederacy,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects whenever they were called into service for the public defense it would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness this desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority it is therefore with the most evident propriety that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the union `` to provide for organizing arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress '',"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the plan of the convention there is none that was so little to have been expected or is so untenable in itself as the one from which this particular provision has been attacked if a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security if standing armies are dangerous to liberty an efficacious power over the militia in the body to whose care the protection of the state is committed ought as far as possible to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions if the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force if it can not avail itself of the former it will be obliged to recur to the latter to render an army unnecessary will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union it has been remarked that there is nowhere any provision in the proposed constitution for calling out the posse comitatus to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty whence it has been inferred that military force was intended to be his only auxiliary there is a striking incoherence in the objections which have appeared and sometimes even from the same quarter not much calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors the same persons who tell us in one breath that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and unlimited inform us in the next that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the posse comitatus the latter fortunately is as much short of the truth as the former exceeds it it would be as absurd to doubt that a right to pass all laws necessary and proper to execute its declared powers would include that of requiring the assistance of the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution of those laws as it would be to believe that a right to enact laws necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of landed property or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to it it being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the posse comitatus is entirely destitute of color it will follow that the conclusion which has been drawn from it in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia is as uncandid as it is illogical what reason could there be to infer that force was intended to be the sole instrument of authority merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary what shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner how shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> by a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself in the hands of the federal government it is observed that select corps may be formed composed of the young and ardent who may be rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power what plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government is impossible to be foreseen but so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as dangerous were the constitution ratified and were i to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this state on the subject of a militia establishment i should hold to him in substance the following discourse,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> `` the project of disciplining all the militia of the united states is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution a tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice it is not a day or even a week that will suffice for the attainment of it to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia would be a real grievance to the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the states to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed because it would not long be endured little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` but though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should as soon as possible be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia the attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need by thus circumscribing the plan it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia ready to take the field whenever the defense of the state shall require it this will not only lessen the call for military establishments but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens this appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army and the best possible security against it if it should exist '',"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed constitution should i reason on the same subject deducing arguments of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and perdition but how the national legislature may reason on the point is a thing which neither they nor i can foresee,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery whether to consider it as a mere trial of skill like the paradoxes of rhetoricians as a disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price or as the serious offspring of political fanaticism where in the name of common-sense are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons our brothers our neighbors our fellow-citizens what shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings sentiments habits and interests what reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the union to prescribe regulations for the militia and to command its services when necessary while the particular states are to have the sole and exclusive appointment of the officers if it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the states ought at once to extinguish it there can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O .

<bos> in reading many of the publications against the constitution a man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance which instead of natural and agreeable images exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes `` gorgons hydras and chimeras dire '' discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents and transforming everything it touches into a monster,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power of calling for the services of the militia that of new hampshire is to be marched to georgia of georgia to new hampshire of new york to kentucky and of kentucky to lake champlain nay the debts due to the french and dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats at one moment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of the people at another moment the militia of virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles to tame the republican contumacy of massachusetts and that of massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic virginians do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the people of america for infallible truths,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism what need of the militia if there should be no army whither would the militia irritated by being called upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen direct their course but to the seat of the tyrants who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of power and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people is this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations do they usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of power calculated to answer no end but to draw upon themselves universal hatred and execration are suppositions of this sort the sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts if we were even to suppose the national rulers actuated by the most ungovernable ambition it is impossible to believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ?

<bos> in times of insurrection or invasion it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring state should be marched into another to resist a common enemy or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition this was frequently the case in respect to the first object in the course of the late war and this mutual succor is indeed a principal end of our political association if the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the union there will be no danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor till its near approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy,"O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> an objection of a nature different from that which has been stated and answered in my last address may perhaps be likewise urged against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens of america it may be said that it would tend to render the government of the union too powerful and to enable it to absorb those residuary authorities which it might be judged proper to leave with the states for local purposes allowing the utmost latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can require i confess i am at a loss to discover what temptation the persons intrusted with the administration of the general government could ever feel to divest the states of the authorities of that description the regulation of the mere domestic police of a state appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition commerce finance negotiation and war seem to comprehend all the objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion and all the powers necessary to those objects ought in the first instance to be lodged in the national depository the administration of private justice between the citizens of the same state the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a similar nature all those things in short which are proper to be provided for by local legislation can never be desirable cares of a general jurisdiction it is therefore improbable that there should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the powers with which they are connected because the attempt to exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be nugatory and the possession of them for that reason would contribute nothing to the dignity to the importance or to the splendor of the national government,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but let it be admitted for argument 's sake that mere wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget that disposition still it may be safely affirmed that the sense of the constituent body of the national representatives or in other words the people of the several states would control the indulgence of so extravagant an appetite it will always be far more easy for the state governments to encroach upon the national authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the state authorities the proof of this proposition turns upon the greater degree of influence which the state governments if they administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence will generally possess over the people a circumstance which at the same time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic weakness in all federal constitutions and that too much pains can not be taken in their organization to give them all the force which is compatible with the principles of liberty,"O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the superiority of influence in favor of the particular governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of the national government but chiefly from the nature of the objects to which the attention of the state administrations would be directed,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it is a known fact in human nature that its affections are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness of the object upon the same principle that a man is more attached to his family than to his neighborhood to his neighborhood than to the community at large the people of each state would be apt to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than towards the government of the union unless the force of that principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of the latter,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this strong propensity of the human heart would find powerful auxiliaries in the objects of state regulation,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .
<bos> the variety of more minute interests which will necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local administrations and which will form so many rivulets of influence running through every part of the society can not be particularized without involving a detail too tedious and uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> there is one transcendant advantage belonging to the province of the state governments which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light -- i mean the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice this of all others is the most powerful most universal and most attractive source of popular obedience and attachment it is that which being the immediate and visible guardian of life and property having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity before the public eye regulating all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake contributes more than any other circumstance to impressing upon the minds of the people affection esteem and reverence towards the government this great cement of society which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of the particular governments independent of all other causes of influence would insure them so decided an empire over their respective citizens as to render them at all times a complete counterpoise and not unfrequently dangerous rivals to the power of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . , O O , O O O , O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the operations of the national government on the other hand falling less immediately under the observation of the mass of the citizens the benefits derived from it will chiefly be perceived and attended to by speculative men relating to more general interests they will be less apt to come home to the feelings of the people and in proportion less likely to inspire an habitual sense of obligation and an active sentiment of attachment,"O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the reasoning on this head has been abundantly exemplified by the experience of all federal constitutions with which we are acquainted and of all others which have borne the least analogy to them,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> though the ancient feudal systems were not strictly speaking confederacies yet they partook of the nature of that species of association there was a common head chieftain or sovereign whose authority extended over the whole nation and a number of subordinate vassals or feudatories who had large portions of land allotted to them and numerous trains of inferior vassals or retainers who occupied and cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience to the persons of whom they held it each principal vassal was a kind of sovereign within his particular demesnes the consequences of this situation were a continual opposition to authority of the sovereign and frequent wars between the great barons or chief feudatories themselves the power of the head of the nation was commonly too weak either to preserve the public peace or to protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate lords this period of european affairs is emphatically styled by historians the times of feudal anarchy,"O O O O O O O , O , , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> when the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous and warlike temper and of superior abilities he would acquire a personal weight and influence which answered for the time the purpose of a more regular authority but in general the power of the barons triumphed over that of the prince and in many instances his dominion was entirely thrown off and the great fiefs were erected into independent principalities or states in those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their dependents the barons or nobles equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people were dreaded and detested by both till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy had the nobles by a conduct of clemency and justice preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> this is not an assertion founded merely in speculation or conjecture among other illustrations of its truth which might be cited scotland will furnish a cogent example the spirit of clanship which was at an early day introduced into that kingdom uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to those of kindred rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch for the power of the monarch till the incorporation with england subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit and reduced it within those rules of subordination which a more rational and more energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the latter kingdom,"O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be compared with the feudal baronies with this advantage in their favor that from the reasons already explained they will generally possess the confidence and good-will of the people and with so important a support will be able effectually to oppose all encroachments of the national government it will be well if they are not able to counteract its legitimate and necessary authority the points of similitude consist in the rivalship of power applicable to both and in the concentration of large portions of the strength of the community into particular deposits in one case at the disposal of individuals in the other case at the disposal of political bodies,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i flatter myself it has been clearly shown in my last number that the particular states under the proposed constitution would have coequal authority with the union in the article of revenue except as to duties on imports as this leaves open to the states far the greatest part of the resources of the community there can be no color for the assertion that they would not possess means as abundant as could be desired for the supply of their own wants independent of all external control that the field is sufficiently wide will more fully appear when we come to advert to the inconsiderable share of the public expenses for which it will fall to the lot of the state governments to provide,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> to argue upon abstract principles that this co-ordinate authority can not exist is to set up supposition and theory against fact and reality however proper such reasonings might be to show that a thing ought not to exist they are wholly to be rejected when they are made use of to prove that it does not exist contrary to the evidence of the fact itself it is well known that in the roman republic the legislative authority in the last resort resided for ages in two different political bodies not as branches of the same legislature but as distinct and independent legislatures in each of which an opposite interest prevailed in one the patrician in the other the plebian many arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities each having power to annul or repeal the acts of the other but a man would have been regarded as frantic who should have attempted at rome to disprove their existence it will be readily understood that i allude to the comitia centuriata and the comitia tributa the former in which the people voted by centuries was so arranged as to give a superiority to the patrician interest in the latter in which numbers prevailed the plebian interest had an entire predominancy and yet these two legislatures coexisted for ages and the roman republic attained to the utmost height of human greatness,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the case particularly under consideration there is no such contradiction as appears in the example cited there is no power on either side to annul the acts of the other and in practice there is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience because in a short course of time the wants of the states will naturally reduce themselves within a very narrow compass and in the interim the united states will in all probability find it convenient to abstain wholly from those objects to which the particular states would be inclined to resort,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this question it will be well to advert to the proportion between the objects that will require a federal provision in respect to revenue and those which will require a state provision we shall discover that the former are altogether unlimited and that the latter are circumscribed within very moderate bounds in pursuing this inquiry we must bear in mind that we are not to confine our view to the present period but to look forward to remote futurity constitutions of civil government are not to be framed upon a calculation of existing exigencies but upon a combination of these with the probable exigencies of ages according to the natural and tried course of human affairs nothing therefore can be more fallacious than to infer the extent of any power proper to be lodged in the national government from an estimate of its immediate necessities there ought to be a capacity to provide for future contingencies as they may happen and as these are illimitable in their nature it is impossible safely to limit that capacity it is true perhaps that a computation might be made with sufficient accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue requisite to discharge the subsisting engagements of the union and to maintain those establishments which for some time to come would suffice in time of peace but would it be wise or would it not rather be the extreme of folly to stop at this point and to leave the government intrusted with the care of the national defense in a state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community against future invasions of the public peace by foreign war or domestic convulsions if on the contrary we ought to exceed this point where can we stop short of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they may arise though it is easy to assert in general terms the possibility of forming a rational judgment of a due provision against probable dangers yet we may safely challenge those who make the assertion to bring forward their data and may affirm that they would be found as vague and uncertain as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of the world observations confined to the mere prospects of internal attacks can deserve no weight though even these will admit of no satisfactory calculation but if we mean to be a commercial people it must form a part of our policy to be able one day to defend that commerce the support of a navy and of naval wars would involve contingencies that must baffle all the efforts of political arithmetic,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> admitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment in politics of tying up the hands of government from offensive war founded upon reasons of state yet certainly we ought not to disable it from guarding the community against the ambition or enmity of other nations a cloud has been for some time hanging over the european world if it should break forth into a storm who can insure us that in its progress a part of its fury would not be spent upon us no reasonable man would hastily pronounce that we are entirely out of its reach or if the combustible materials that now seem to be collecting should be dissipated without coming to maturity or if a flame should be kindled without extending to us what security can we have that our tranquillity will long remain undisturbed from some other cause or from some other quarter let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our option that however moderate or unambitious we may be we can not count upon the moderation or hope to extinguish the ambition of others who could have imagined at the conclusion of the last war that france and britain wearied and exhausted as they both were would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other to judge from the history of mankind we shall be compelled to conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and beneficent sentiments of peace and that to model our political systems upon speculations of lasting tranquillity is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> what are the chief sources of expense in every government what has occasioned that enormous accumulation of debts with which several of the european nations are oppressed the answers plainly is wars and rebellions the support of those institutions which are necessary to guard the body politic against these two most mortal diseases of society the expenses arising from those institutions which are relative to the mere domestic police of a state to the support of its legislative executive and judicial departments with their different appendages and to the encouragement of agriculture and manufactures which will comprehend almost all the objects of state expenditure are insignificant in comparison with those which relate to the national defense,"O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> in the kingdom of great britain where all the ostentatious apparatus of monarchy is to be provided for not above a fifteenth part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class of expenses last mentioned the other fourteen fifteenths are absorbed in the payment of the interest of debts contracted for carrying on the wars in which that country has been engaged and in the maintenance of fleets and armies if on the one hand it should be observed that the expenses incurred in the prosecution of the ambitious enterprises and vainglorious pursuits of a monarchy are not a proper standard by which to judge of those which might be necessary in a republic it ought on the other hand to be remarked that there should be as great a disproportion between the profusion and extravagance of a wealthy kingdom in its domestic administration and the frugality and economy which in that particular become the modest simplicity of republican government if we balance a proper deduction from one side against that which it is supposed ought to be made from the other the proportion may still be considered as holding good,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but let us advert to the large debt which we have ourselves contracted in a single war and let us only calculate on a common share of the events which disturb the peace of nations and we shall instantly perceive without the aid of any elaborate illustration that there must always be an immense disproportion between the objects of federal and state expenditures it is true that several of the states separately are encumbered with considerable debts which are an excrescence of the late war but this can not happen again if the proposed system be adopted and when these debts are discharged the only call for revenue of any consequence which the state governments will continue to experience will be for the mere support of their respective civil list to which if we add all contingencies the total amount in every state ought to fall considerably short of two hundred thousand pounds,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in framing a government for posterity as well as ourselves we ought in those provisions which are designed to be permanent to calculate not on temporary but on permanent causes of expense if this principle be a just one our attention would be directed to a provision in favor of the state governments for an annual sum of about two hundred thousand pounds while the exigencies of the union could be susceptible of no limits even in imagination in this view of the subject by what logic can it be maintained that the local governments ought to command in perpetuity an exclusive source of revenue for any sum beyond the extent of two hundred thousand pounds to extend its power further in exclusion of the authority of the union would be to take the resources of the community out of those hands which stood in need of them for the public welfare in order to put them into other hands which could have no just or proper occasion for them,"O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O .

<bos> suppose then the convention had been inclined to proceed upon the principle of a repartition of the objects of revenue between the union and its members in proportion to their comparative necessities what particular fund could have been selected for the use of the states that would not either have been too much or too little too little for their present too much for their future wants as to the line of separation between external and internal taxes this would leave to the states at a rough computation the command of two thirds of the resources of the community to defray from a tenth to a twentieth part of its expenses and to the union one third of the resources of the community to defray from nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses if we desert this boundary and content ourselves with leaving to the states an exclusive power of taxing houses and lands there would still be a great disproportion between the means and the end the possession of one third of the resources of the community to supply at most one tenth of its wants if any fund could have been selected and appropriated equal to and not greater than the object it would have been inadequate to the discharge of the existing debts of the particular states and would have left them dependent on the union for a provision for this purpose,"O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ?

<bos> the preceding train of observation will justify the position which has been elsewhere laid down that `` a concurrent jurisdiction in the article of taxation was the only admissible substitute for an entire subordination in respect to this branch of power of state authority to that of the union '' any separation of the objects of revenue that could have been fallen upon would have amounted to a sacrifice of the great interests of the union to the power of the individual states the convention thought the concurrent jurisdiction preferable to that subordination and it is evident that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite constitutional power of taxation in the federal government with an adequate and independent power in the states to provide for their own necessities there remain a few other lights in which this important subject of taxation will claim a further consideration,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the course of the preceding papers i have endeavored my fellow-citizens to place before you in a clear and convincing light the importance of union to your political safety and happiness i have unfolded to you a complication of dangers to which you would be exposed should you permit that sacred knot which binds the people of america together be severed or dissolved by ambition or by avarice by jealousy or by misrepresentation in the sequel of the inquiry through which i propose to accompany you the truths intended to be inculcated will receive further confirmation from facts and arguments hitherto unnoticed if the road over which you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you tedious or irksome you will recollect that you are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the attention of a free people that the field through which you have to travel is in itself spacious and that the difficulties of the journey have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes with which sophistry has beset the way it will be my aim to remove the obstacles from your progress in as compendious a manner as it can be done without sacrificing utility to despatch,"O O O O O O O , O O , O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in pursuance of the plan which i have laid down for the discussion of the subject the point next in order to be examined is the `` insufficiency of the present confederation to the preservation of the union '' it may perhaps be asked what need there is of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position which is not either controverted or doubted to which the understandings and feelings of all classes of men assent and which in substance is admitted by the opponents as well as by the friends of the new constitution it must in truth be acknowledged that however these may differ in other respects they in general appear to harmonize in this sentiment at least that there are material imperfections in our national system and that something is necessary to be done to rescue us from impending anarchy the facts that support this opinion are no longer objects of speculation they have forced themselves upon the sensibility of the people at large and have at length extorted from those whose mistaken policy has had the principal share in precipitating the extremity at which we are arrived a reluctant confession of the reality of those defects in the scheme of our federal government which have been long pointed out and regretted by the intelligent friends of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> we may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation there is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience are there engagements to the performance of which we are held by every tie respectable among men these are the subjects of constant and unblushing violation do we owe debts to foreigners and to our own citizens contracted in a time of imminent peril for the preservation of our political existence these remain without any proper or satisfactory provision for their discharge have we valuable territories and important posts in the possession of a foreign power which by express stipulations ought long since to have been surrendered these are still retained to the prejudice of our interests not less than of our rights are we in a condition to resent or to repel the aggression we have neither troops nor treasury nor government.1 are we even in a condition to remonstrate with dignity the just imputations on our own faith in respect to the same treaty ought first to be removed are we entitled by nature and compact to a free participation in the navigation of the mississippi spain excludes us from it is public credit an indispensable resource in time of public danger we seem to have abandoned its cause as desperate and irretrievable is commerce of importance to national wealth ours is at the lowest point of declension is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments the imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants of mimic sovereignty is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress the price of improved land in most parts of the country is much lower than can be accounted for by the quantity of waste land at market and can only be fully explained by that want of private and public confidence which are so alarmingly prevalent among all ranks and which have a direct tendency to depreciate property of every kind is private credit the friend and patron of industry that most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of money to shorten an enumeration of particulars which can afford neither pleasure nor instruction it may in general be demanded what indication is there of national disorder poverty and insignificance that could befall a community so peculiarly blessed with natural advantages as we are which does not form a part of the dark catalogue of our public misfortunes,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this is the melancholy situation to which we have been brought by those very maxims and councils which would now deter us from adopting the proposed constitution and which not content with having conducted us to the brink of a precipice seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss that awaits us below here my countrymen impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people let us make a firm stand for our safety our tranquillity our dignity our reputation let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . , O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O , O .

<bos> it is true as has been before observed that facts too stubborn to be resisted have produced a species of general assent to the abstract proposition that there exist material defects in our national system but the usefulness of the concession on the part of the old adversaries of federal measures is destroyed by a strenuous opposition to a remedy upon the only principles that can give it a chance of success while they admit that the government of the united states is destitute of energy they contend against conferring upon it those powers which are requisite to supply that energy they seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable at an augmentation of federal authority without a diminution of state authority at sovereignty in the union and complete independence in the members they still in fine seem to cherish with blind devotion the political monster of an imperium in imperio this renders a full display of the principal defects of the confederation necessary in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building which can not be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric,"O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the great and radical vice in the construction of the existing confederation is in the principle of legislation for states or governments in their corporate or collective capacities and as contradistinguished from the individuals of which they consist though this principle does not run through all the powers delegated to the union yet it pervades and governs those on which the efficacy of the rest depends except as to the rule of appointment the united states has an indefinite discretion to make requisitions for men and money but they have no authority to raise either by regulations extending to the individual citizens of america the consequence of this is that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws constitutionally binding on the members of the union yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the states observe or disregard at their option,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is a singular instance of the capriciousness of the human mind that after all the admonitions we have had from experience on this head there should still be found men who object to the new constitution for deviating from a principle which has been found the bane of the old and which is in itself evidently incompatible with the idea of government a principle in short which if it is to be executed at all must substitute the violent and sanguinary agency of the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> there is nothing absurd or impracticable in the idea of a league or alliance between independent nations for certain defined purposes precisely stated in a treaty regulating all the details of time place circumstance and quantity leaving nothing to future discretion and depending for its execution on the good faith of the parties compacts of this kind exist among all civilized nations subject to the usual vicissitudes of peace and war of observance and non-observance as the interests or passions of the contracting powers dictate in the early part of the present century there was an epidemical rage in europe for this species of compacts from which the politicians of the times fondly hoped for benefits which were never realized with a view to establishing the equilibrium of power and the peace of that part of the world all the resources of negotiation were exhausted and triple and quadruple alliances were formed but they were scarcely formed before they were broken giving an instructive but afflicting lesson to mankind how little dependence is to be placed on treaties which have no other sanction than the obligations of good faith and which oppose general considerations of peace and justice to the impulse of any immediate interest or passion,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , , O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if the particular states in this country are disposed to stand in a similar relation to each other and to drop the project of a general discretionary superintendence the scheme would indeed be pernicious and would entail upon us all the mischiefs which have been enumerated under the first head but it would have the merit of being at least consistent and practicable abandoning all views towards a confederate government this would bring us to a simple alliance offensive and defensive and would place us in a situation to be alternate friends and enemies of each other as our mutual jealousies and rivalships nourished by the intrigues of foreign nations should prescribe to us,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> but if we are unwilling to be placed in this perilous situation if we still will adhere to the design of a national government or which is the same thing of a superintending power under the direction of a common council we must resolve to incorporate into our plan those ingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government we must extend the authority of the union to the persons of the citizens -- the only proper objects of government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> government implies the power of making laws it is essential to the idea of a law that it be attended with a sanction or in other words a penalty or punishment for disobedience if there be no penalty annexed to disobedience the resolutions or commands which pretend to be laws will in fact amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation this penalty whatever it may be can only be inflicted in two ways by the agency of the courts and ministers of justice or by military force by the coercion of the magistracy or by the coercion of arms the first kind can evidently apply only to men the last kind must of necessity be employed against bodies politic or communities or states it is evident that there is no process of a court by which the observance of the laws can in the last resort be enforced sentences may be denounced against them for violations of their duty but these sentences can only be carried into execution by the sword in an association where the general authority is confined to the collective bodies of the communities that compose it every breach of the laws must involve a state of war and military execution must become the only instrument of civil obedience such a state of things can certainly not deserve the name of government nor would any prudent man choose to commit his happiness to it,"O O O O O O O .

<bos> there was a time when we were told that breaches by the states of the regulations of the federal authority were not to be expected that a sense of common interest would preside over the conduct of the respective members and would beget a full compliance with all the constitutional requisitions of the union this language at the present day would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom experience it at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power why has government been instituted at all because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals the contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons regard to reputation has a less active influence when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one a spirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses for which they would blush in a private capacity,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in addition to all this there is in the nature of sovereign power an impatience of control that disposes those who are invested with the exercise of it to look with an evil eye upon all external attempts to restrain or direct its operations from this spirit it happens that in every political association which is formed upon the principle of uniting in a common interest a number of lesser sovereignties there will be found a kind of eccentric tendency in the subordinate or inferior orbs by the operation of which there will be a perpetual effort in each to fly off from the common centre this tendency is not difficult to be accounted for it has its origin in the love of power power controlled or abridged is almost always the rival and enemy of that power by which it is controlled or abridged this simple proposition will teach us how little reason there is to expect that the persons intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the particular members of a confederacy will at all times be ready with perfect good-humor and an unbiased regard to the public weal to execute the resolutions or decrees of the general authority the reverse of this results from the constitution of human nature,"O O O O O , O , O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if therefore the measures of the confederacy can not be executed without the intervention of the particular administrations there will be little prospect of their being executed at all the rulers of the respective members whether they have a constitutional right to do it or not will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves they will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption all this will be done and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state which is essential to a right judgment and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects which can hardly fail to mislead the decision the same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted and the execution of the plans framed by the councils of the whole will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies who have seen how difficult it often is where there is no exterior pressure of circumstances to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies deliberating at a distance from each other at different times and under different impressions long to co-operate in the same views and pursuits,"O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite under the confederation to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the union it has happened as was to have been foreseen the measures of the union have not been executed the delinquencies of the states have step by step matured themselves to an extreme which has at length arrested all the wheels of the national government and brought them to an awful stand congress at this time scarcely possess the means of keeping up the forms of administration till the states can have time to agree upon a more substantial substitute for the present shadow of a federal government things did not come to this desperate extremity at once the causes which have been specified produced at first only unequal and disproportionate degrees of compliance with the requisitions of the union the greater deficiencies of some states furnished the pretext of example and the temptation of interest to the complying or to the least delinquent states why should we do more in proportion than those who are embarked with us in the same political voyage why should we consent to bear more than our proper share of the common burden these were suggestions which human selfishness could not withstand and which even speculative men who looked forward to remote consequences could not without hesitation combat each state yielding to the persuasive voice of immediate interest or convenience has successively withdrawn its support till the frail and tottering edifice seems ready to fall upon our heads and to crush us beneath its ruins,"O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the necessity of a constitution at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the preservation of the union is the point at the examination of which we are now arrived,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> this inquiry will naturally divide itself into three branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those objects the persons upon whom that power ought to operate its distribution and organization will more properly claim our attention under the succeeding head,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the principal purposes to be answered by union are these the common defense of the members the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the states the superintendence of our intercourse political and commercial with foreign countries,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O , O O ."
<bos> the authorities essential to the common defense are these to raise armies to build and equip fleets to prescribe rules for the government of both to direct their operations to provide for their support these powers ought to exist without limitation because it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies or the correspondent extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them the circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite and for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed this power ought to be coextensive with all the possible combinations of such circumstances and ought to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside over the common defense,"O O O O O O O O O : O O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O O ; O O O ; O O O O .

<bos> this is one of those truths which to a correct and unprejudiced mind carries its own evidence along with it and may be obscured but can not be made plainer by argument or reasoning it rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal the means ought to be proportioned to the end the persons from whose agency the attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> whether there ought to be a federal government intrusted with the care of the common defense is a question in the first instance open for discussion but the moment it is decided in the affirmative it will follow that that government ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to complete execution of its trust and unless it can be shown that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate limits unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed it must be admitted as a necessary consequence that there can be no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defense and protection of the community in any matter essential to its efficacy that is in any matter essential to the formation direction or support of the national forces,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> defective as the present confederation has been proved to be this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the framers of it though they have not made proper or adequate provision for its exercise congress have an unlimited discretion to make requisitions of men and money to govern the army and navy to direct their operations as their requisitions are made constitutionally binding upon the states who are in fact under the most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of them the intention evidently was that the united states should command whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the `` common defense and general welfare '' it was presumed that a sense of their true interests and a regard to the dictates of good faith would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual performance of the duty of the members to the federal head,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the experiment has however demonstrated that this expectation was ill-founded and illusory and the observations made under the last head will i imagine have sufficed to convince the impartial and discerning that there is an absolute necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the system that if we are in earnest about giving the union energy and duration we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon the states in their collective capacities we must extend the laws of the federal government to the individual citizens of america we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions as equally impracticable and unjust the result from all this is that the union ought to be invested with full power to levy troops to build and equip fleets and to raise the revenues which will be required for the formation and support of an army and navy in the customary and ordinary modes practiced in other governments,"O O O , , O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O , , O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> if the circumstances of our country are such as to demand a compound instead of a simple a confederate instead of a sole government the essential point which will remain to be adjusted will be to discriminate the objects as far as it can be done which shall appertain to the different provinces or departments of power allowing to each the most ample authority for fulfilling the objects committed to its charge shall the union be constituted the guardian of the common safety are fleets and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose the government of the union must be empowered to pass all laws and to make all regulations which have relation to them the same must be the case in respect to commerce and to every other matter to which its jurisdiction is permitted to extend is the administration of justice between the citizens of the same state the proper department of the local governments these must possess all the authorities which are connected with this object and with every other that may be allotted to their particular cognizance and direction not to confer in each case a degree of power commensurate to the end would be to violate the most obvious rules of prudence and propriety and improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> who is likely to make suitable provisions for the public defense as that body to which the guardianship of the public safety is confided which as the centre of information will best understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that threaten as the representative of the whole will feel itself most deeply interested in the preservation of every part which from the responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper exertions and which by the extension of its authority throughout the states can alone establish uniformity and concert in the plans and measures by which the common safety is to be secured is there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal government the care of the general defense and leaving in the state governments the effective powers by which it is to be provided for is not a want of co-operation the infallible consequence of such a system and will not weakness disorder an undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war an unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense be its natural and inevitable concomitants have we not had unequivocal experience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we have just accomplished,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> every view we may take of the subject as candid inquirers after truth will serve to convince us that it is both unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined authority as to all those objects which are intrusted to its management it will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful attention of the people to see that it be modeled in such a manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite powers if any plan which has been or may be offered to our consideration should not upon a dispassionate inspection be found to answer this description it ought to be rejected a government the constitution of which renders it unfit to be trusted with all the powers which a free people ought to delegate to any government would be an unsafe and improper depositary of the national interests wherever these can with propriety be confided the coincident powers may safely accompany them this is the true result of all just reasoning upon the subject and the adversaries of the plan promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to showing that the internal structure of the proposed government was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people they ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers the powers are not too extensive for the objects of federal administration or in other words for the management of our national interests nor can any satisfactory argument be framed to show that they are chargeable with such an excess if it be true as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the other side that the difficulty arises from the nature of the thing and that the extent of the country will not permit us to form a government in which such ample powers can safely be reposed it would prove that we ought to contract our views and resort to the expedient of separate confederacies which will move within more practicable spheres for the absurdity must continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the direction of the most essential national interests without daring to trust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their proper and efficient management let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions but firmly embrace a rational alternative,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i trust however that the impracticability of one general system can not be shown i am greatly mistaken if any thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency and i flatter myself that the observations which have been made in the course of these papers have served to place the reverse of that position in as clear a light as any matter still in the womb of time and experience can be susceptible of this at all events must be evident that the very difficulty itself drawn from the extent of the country is the strongest argument in favor of an energetic government for any other can certainly never preserve the union of so large an empire if we embrace the tenets of those who oppose the adoption of the proposed constitution as the standard of our political creed we can not fail to verify the gloomy doctrines which predict the impracticability of a national system pervading entire limits of the present confederacy,"O O , , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection it is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of greece and italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated and at the rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy if they exhibit occasional calms these only serve as short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed if now and then intervals of felicity open to view we behold them with a mixture of regret arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage if momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> from the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments not only against the forms of republican government but against the very principles of civil liberty they have decried all free government as inconsistent with the order of society and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partisans happily for mankind stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty which have flourished for ages have in a few glorious instances refuted their gloomy sophisms and i trust america will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices not less magnificent which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> but it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of republican government were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken if it had been found impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible the science of politics however like most other sciences has received great improvement the efficacy of various principles is now well understood which were either not known at all or imperfectly known to the ancients the regular distribution of power into distinct departments the introduction of legislative balances and checks the institution of courts composed of judges holding their offices during good behavior the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election these are wholly new discoveries or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times they are means and powerful means by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided to this catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government i shall venture however novel it may appear to some to add one more on a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the new constitution i mean the enlargement of the orbit within which such systems are to revolve either in respect to the dimensions of a single state or to the consolidation of several smaller states into one great confederacy the latter is that which immediately concerns the object under consideration it will however be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single state which shall be attended to in another place,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the utility of a confederacy as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of states as to increase their external force and security is in reality not a new idea it has been practiced upon in different countries and ages and has received the sanction of the most approved writers on the subject of politics the opponents of the plan proposed have with great assiduity cited and circulated the observations of montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government but they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> when montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these states neither virginia massachusetts pennsylvania new york north carolina nor georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply if we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little jealous clashing tumultuous commonwealths the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord and the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt some of the writers who have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been aware of the dilemma and have even been bold enough to hint at the division of the larger states as a desirable thing such an infatuated policy such a desperate expedient might by the multiplication of petty offices answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of america,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> referring the examination of the principle itself to another place as has been already mentioned it will be sufficient to remark here that in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion it would only dictate a reduction of the size of the more considerable members of the union but would not militate against their being all comprehended in one confederate government and this is the true question in the discussion of which we are at present interested,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> so far are the suggestions of montesquieu from standing in opposition to a general union of the states that he explicitly treats of a confederate republic as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."

<bos> i have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in favor of the union and must effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to make they have at the same time an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this paper which is to illustrate the tendency of the union to repress domestic faction and insurrection,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a distinction more subtle than accurate has been raised between a confederacy and a consolidation of the states the essential characteristic of the first is said to be the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed it is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration an exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government these positions are in the main arbitrary they are supported neither by principle nor precedent it has indeed happened that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner which the distinction taken notice of supposes to be inherent in their nature but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice which serve to prove as far as example will go that there is no absolute rule on the subject and it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed it has been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government,"O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the definition of a confederate republic seems simply to be `` an assemblage of societies '' or an association of two or more states into one state the extent modifications and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion so long as the separate organization of the members be not abolished so long as it exists by a constitutional necessity for local purposes though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union it would still be in fact and in theory an association of states or a confederacy the proposed constitution so far from implying an abolition of the state governments makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty by allowing them a direct representation in the senate and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power this fully corresponds in every rational import of the terms with the idea of a federal government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the lycian confederacy which consisted of twenty-three cities or republics the largest were entitled to three votes in the common council those of the middle class to two and the smallest to one the common council had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective cities this was certainly the most delicate species of interference in their internal administration for if there be any thing that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions it is the appointment of their own officers yet montesquieu speaking of this association says `` were i to give a model of an excellent confederate republic it would be that of lycia '' thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian and we shall be led to conclude that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory,"O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> duration in office has been mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the executive authority this has relation to two objects to the personal firmness of the executive magistrate in the employment of his constitutional powers and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices with regard to the first it must be evident that the longer the duration in office the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage it is a general principle of human nature that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it will be less attached to what he holds by a momentary or uncertain title than to what he enjoys by a durable or certain title and of course will be willing to risk more for the sake of the one than for the sake of the other this remark is not less applicable to a political privilege or honor or trust than to any article of ordinary property the inference from it is that a man acting in the capacity of chief magistrate under a consciousness that in a very short time he must lay down his office will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it to hazard any material censure or perplexity from the independent exertion of his powers or from encountering the ill-humors however transient which may happen to prevail either in a considerable part of the society itself or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body if the case should only be that he might lay it down unless continued by a new choice and if he should be desirous of being continued his wishes conspiring with his fears would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity or debase his fortitude in either case feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the executive to a prevailing current either in the community or in the legislature as its best recommendation but such men entertain very crude notions as well of the purposes for which government was instituted as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted the republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the management of their affairs but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests it is a just observation that the people commonly intend the public good this often applies to their very errors but their good sense would despise the adulator who should pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting it they know from experience that they sometimes err and the wonder is that they so seldom err as they do beset as they continually are by the wiles of parasites and sycophants by the snares of the ambitious the avaricious the desperate by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they deserve it and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it when occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary delusion in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> but however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the legislature the latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former and at other times the people may be entirely neutral in either supposition it is certainly desirable that the executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the same rule which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other to what purpose separate the executive or the judiciary from the legislative if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative such a separation must be merely nominal and incapable of producing the ends for which it was established it is one thing to be subordinate to the laws and another to be dependent on the legislative body the first comports with the last violates the fundamental principles of good government and whatever may be the forms of the constitution unites all power in the same hands the tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding numbers in governments purely republican this tendency is almost irresistible the representatives of the people in a popular assembly seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter as if the exercise of its rights by either the executive or judiciary were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity they often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other departments and as they commonly have the people on their side they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the constitution,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the executive on the legislature unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other one answer to this inquiry may be drawn from the principle already remarked that is from the slender interest a man is apt to take in a short-lived advantage and the little inducement it affords him to expose himself on account of it to any considerable inconvenience or hazard another answer perhaps more obvious though not more conclusive will result from the consideration of the influence of the legislative body over the people which might be employed to prevent the re-election of a man who by an upright resistance to any sinister project of that body should have made himself obnoxious to its resentment,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may be asked also whether a duration of four years would answer the end proposed and if it would not whether a less period which would at least be recommended by greater security against ambitious designs would not for that reason be preferable to a longer period which was at the same time too short for the purpose of inspiring the desired firmness and independence of the magistrate,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it can not be affirmed that a duration of four years or any other limited duration would completely answer the end proposed but it would contribute towards it in a degree which would have a material influence upon the spirit and character of the government between the commencement and termination of such a period there would always be a considerable interval in which the prospect of annihilation would be sufficiently remote not to have an improper effect upon the conduct of a man indued with a tolerable portion of fortitude and in which he might reasonably promise himself that there would be time enough before it arrived to make the community sensible of the propriety of the measures he might incline to pursue though it be probable that as he approached the moment when the public were by a new election to signify their sense of his conduct his confidence and with it his firmness would decline yet both the one and the other would derive support from the opportunities which his previous continuance in the station had afforded him of establishing himself in the esteem and good-will of his constituents he might then hazard with safety in proportion to the proofs he had given of his wisdom and integrity and to the title he had acquired to the respect and attachment of his fellow-citizens as on the one hand a duration of four years will contribute to the firmness of the executive in a sufficient degree to render it a very valuable ingredient in the composition so on the other it is not enough to justify any alarm for the public liberty if a british house of commons from the most feeble beginnings from the mere power of assenting or disagreeing to the imposition of a new tax have by rapid strides reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the legislature if they have been able in one instance to abolish both the royalty and the aristocracy and to overturn all the ancient establishments as well in the church as state if they have been able on a recent occasion to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation1 attempted by them what would be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years duration with the confined authorities of a president of the united states what but that he might be unequal to the task which the constitution assigns him i shall only add that if his duration be such as to leave a doubt of his firmness that doubt is inconsistent with a jealousy of his encroachments,"O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> before we proceed to examine any other objections to an indefinite power of taxation in the union i shall make one general remark which is that if the jurisdiction of the national government in the article of revenue should be restricted to particular objects it would naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to fall upon those objects two evils would spring from this source the oppression of particular branches of industry and an unequal distribution of the taxes as well among the several states as among the citizens of the same state,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> suppose as has been contended for the federal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports it is evident that the government for want of being able to command other resources would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess there are persons who imagine that they can never be carried to too great a length since the higher they are the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant consumption to produce a favorable balance of trade and to promote domestic manufactures but all extremes are pernicious in various ways exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general spirit of smuggling which is always prejudicial to the fair trader and eventually to the revenue itself they tend to render other classes of the community tributary in an improper degree to the manufacturing classes to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets they sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less advantage and in the last place they oppress the merchant who is often obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer when the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market the consumer generally pays the duty but when the markets happen to be overstocked a great proportion falls upon the merchant and sometimes not only exhausts his profits but breaks in upon his capital i am apt to think that a division of the duty between the seller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined it is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity in exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it the merchant especially in a country of small commercial capital is often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more expeditious sale,"O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the maxim that the consumer is the payer is so much oftener true than the reverse of the proposition that it is far more equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common stock than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing states but it is not so generally true as to render it equitable that those duties should form the only national fund when they are paid by the merchant they operate as an additional tax upon the importing state whose citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers in this view they are productive of inequality among the states which inequality would be increased with the increased extent of the duties the confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts would be attended with inequality from a different cause between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing states the states which can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants by their own manufactures will not according to their numbers or wealth consume so great a proportion of imported articles as those states which are not in the same favorable situation they would not therefore in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities to make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to excises the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures new york is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the union to external taxation may be aware of new york is an importing state and is not likely speedily to be to any great extent a manufacturing state she would of course suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the union to commercial imposts,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> so far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed conformably to a remark made in another part of these papers that the interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such an extreme i readily admit that this would be the case as long as other resources were open but if the avenues to them were closed hope stimulated by necessity would beget experiments fortified by rigorous precautions and additional penalties which for a time would have the intended effect till there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new precautions the first success would be apt to inspire false opinions which it might require a long course of subsequent experience to correct necessity especially in politics often occasions false hopes false reasonings and a system of measures correspondingly erroneous but even if this supposed excess should not be a consequence of the limitation of the federal power of taxation the inequalities spoken of would still ensue though not in the same degree from the other causes that have been noticed let us now return to the examination of objections,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> one which if we may judge from the frequency of its repetition seems most to be relied on is that the house of representatives is not sufficiently numerous for the reception of all the different classes of citizens in order to combine the interests and feelings of every part of the community and to produce a due sympathy between the representative body and its constituents this argument presents itself under a very specious and seducing form and is well calculated to lay hold of the prejudices of those to whom it is addressed but when we come to dissect it with attention it will appear to be made up of nothing but fair-sounding words the object it seems to aim at is in the first place impracticable and in the sense in which it is contended for is unnecessary i reserve for another place the discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the representative body in respect to numbers and shall content myself with examining here the particular use which has been made of a contrary supposition in reference to the immediate subject of our inquiries,"O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people by persons of each class is altogether visionary unless it were expressly provided in the constitution that each different occupation should send one or more members the thing would never take place in practice mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in preference to persons of their own professions or trades those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and industry many of them indeed are immediately connected with the operations of commerce they know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend and they are aware that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themselves they are sensible that their habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired endowments without which in a deliberative assembly the greatest natural abilities are for the most part useless and that the influence and weight and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public councils unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests these considerations and many others that might be mentioned prove and experience confirms it that artisans and manufacturers will commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and those whom they recommend we must therefore consider merchants as the natural representatives of all these classes of the community,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O .

<bos> with regard to the learned professions little need be observed they truly form no distinct interest in society and according to their situation and talents will be indiscriminately the objects of the confidence and choice of each other and of other parts of the community,"O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> nothing remains but the landed interest and this in a political view and particularly in relation to taxes i take to be perfectly united from the wealthiest landlord down to the poorest tenant no tax can be laid on land which will not affect the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a single acre every landholder will therefore have a common interest to keep the taxes on land as low as possible and common interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of sympathy but if we even could suppose a distinction of interest between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer what reason is there to conclude that the first would stand a better chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last if we take fact as our guide and look into our own senate and assembly we shall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail in both nor is this less the case in the senate which consists of a smaller number than in the assembly which is composed of a greater number where the qualifications of the electors are the same whether they have to choose a small or a large number their votes will fall upon those in whom they have most confidence whether these happen to be men of large fortunes or of moderate property or of no property at all,"O O O O O O ; O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is said to be necessary that all classes of citizens should have some of their own number in the representative body in order that their feelings and interests may be the better understood and attended to but we have seen that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the votes of the people free where this is the case the representative body with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government will be composed of landholders merchants and men of the learned professions but where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of men will not the landholder know and feel whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property and will he not from his own interest in that species of property be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or encumber it will not the merchant understand and be disposed to cultivate as far as may be proper the interests of the mechanic and manufacturing arts to which his commerce is so nearly allied will not the man of the learned profession who will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different branches of industry be likely to prove an impartial arbiter between them ready to promote either so far as it shall appear to him conducive to the general interests of the society,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we take into the account the momentary humors or dispositions which may happen to prevail in particular parts of the society and to which a wise administration will never be inattentive is the man whose situation leads to extensive inquiry and information less likely to be a competent judge of their nature extent and foundation than one whose observation does not travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and acquaintances is it not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the people and who is dependent on the suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors should take care to inform himself of their dispositions and inclinations and should be willing to allow them their proper degree of influence upon his conduct this dependence and the necessity of being bound himself and his posterity by the laws to which he gives his assent are the true and they are the strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the constituent,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> there is no part of the administration of government that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of the principles of political economy so much as the business of taxation the man who understands those principles best will be least likely to resort to oppressive expedients or sacrifice any particular class of citizens to the procurement of revenue it might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance will always be the least burdensome there can be no doubt that in order to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation it is necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted with the general genius habits and modes of thinking of the people at large and with the resources of the country and this is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the interests and feelings of the people in any other sense the proposition has either no meaning or an absurd one and in that sense let every considerate citizen judge for himself where the requisite qualification is most likely to be found,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> that there may happen cases in which the national government may be necessitated to resort to force can not be denied our own experience has corroborated the lessons taught by the examples of other nations that emergencies of this sort will sometimes arise in all societies however constituted that seditions and insurrections are unhappily maladies as inseparable from the body politic as tumors and eruptions from the natural body that the idea of governing at all times by the simple force of law which we have been told is the only admissible principle of republican government has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors whose sagacity disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> should such emergencies at any time happen under the national government there could be no remedy but force the means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief if it should be a slight commotion in a small part of a state the militia of the residue would be adequate to its suppression and the national presumption is that they would be ready to do their duty an insurrection whatever may be its immediate cause eventually endangers all government regard to the public peace if not to the rights of the union would engage the citizens to whom the contagion had not communicated itself to oppose the insurgents and if the general government should be found in practice conducive to the prosperity and felicity of the people it were irrational to believe that they would be disinclined to its support,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> if on the contrary the insurrection should pervade a whole state or a principal part of it the employment of a different kind of force might become unavoidable it appears that massachusetts found it necessary to raise troops for repressing the disorders within that state that pennsylvania from the mere apprehension of commotions among a part of her citizens has thought proper to have recourse to the same measure suppose the state of new york had been inclined to re-establish her lost jurisdiction over the inhabitants of vermont could she have hoped for success in such an enterprise from the efforts of the militia alone would she not have been compelled to raise and to maintain a more regular force for the execution of her design if it must then be admitted that the necessity of recurring to a force different from the militia in cases of this extraordinary nature is applicable to the state governments themselves why should the possibility that the national government might be under a like necessity in similar extremities be made an objection to its existence is it not surprising that men who declare an attachment to the union in the abstract should urge as an objection to the proposed constitution what applies with tenfold weight to the plan for which they contend and what as far as it has any foundation in truth is an inevitable consequence of civil society upon an enlarged scale who would not prefer that possibility to the unceasing agitations and frequent revolutions which are the continual scourges of petty republics,"O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> let us pursue this examination in another light suppose in lieu of one general system two or three or even four confederacies were to be formed would not the same difficulty oppose itself to the operations of either of these confederacies would not each of them be exposed to the same casualties and when these happened be obliged to have recourse to the same expedients for upholding its authority which are objected to in a government for all the states would the militia in this supposition be more ready or more able to support the federal authority than in the case of a general union all candid and intelligent men must upon due consideration acknowledge that the principle of the objection is equally applicable to either of the two cases and that whether we have one government for all the states or different governments for different parcels of them or even if there should be an entire separation of the states there might sometimes be a necessity to make use of a force constituted differently from the militia to preserve the peace of the community and to maintain the just authority of the laws against those violent invasions of them which amount to insurrections and rebellions,"O O O O O O O O . , O O O O O , , O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> independent of all other reasonings upon the subject it is a full answer to those who require a more peremptory provision against military establishments in time of peace to say that the whole power of the proposed government is to be in the hands of the representatives of the people this is the essential and after all only efficacious security for the rights and privileges of the people which is attainable in civil society.1,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if the representatives of the people betray their constituents there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state in a single state if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers the different parcels subdivisions or districts of which it consists having no distinct government in each can take no regular measures for defense the citizens must rush tumultuously to arms without concert without system without resource except in their courage and despair the usurpers clothed with the forms of legal authority can too often crush the opposition in embryo the smaller the extent of the territory the more difficult will it be for the people to form a regular or systematic plan of opposition and the more easy will it be to defeat their early efforts intelligence can be more speedily obtained of their preparations and movements and the military force in the possession of the usurpers can be more rapidly directed against the part where the opposition has begun in this situation there must be a peculiar coincidence of circumstances to insure success to the popular resistance,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them the natural strength of the people in a large community in proportion to the artificial strength of the government is greater than in a small and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny but in a confederacy the people without exaggeration may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate power being almost always the rival of power the general government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments and these will have the same disposition towards the general government the people by throwing themselves into either scale will infallibly make it preponderate if their rights are invaded by either they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress how wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prized,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may safely be received as an axiom in our political system that the state governments will in all possible contingencies afford complete security against invasions of the public liberty by the national authority projects of usurpation can not be masked under pretenses so likely to escape the penetration of select bodies of men as of the people at large the legislatures will have better means of information they can discover the danger at a distance and possessing all the organs of civil power and the confidence of the people they can at once adopt a regular plan of opposition in which they can combine all the resources of the community they can readily communicate with each other in the different states and unite their common forces for the protection of their common liberty,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the great extent of the country is a further security we have already experienced its utility against the attacks of a foreign power and it would have precisely the same effect against the enterprises of ambitious rulers in the national councils if the federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one state the distant states would have it in their power to make head with fresh forces the advantages obtained in one place must be abandoned to subdue the opposition in others and the moment the part which had been reduced to submission was left to itself its efforts would be renewed and its resistance revive,"O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> we should recollect that the extent of the military force must at all events be regulated by the resources of the country for a long time to come it will not be possible to maintain a large army and as the means of doing this increase the population and natural strength of the community will proportionably increase when will the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire who are in a situation through the medium of their state governments to take measures for their own defense with all the celerity regularity and system of independent nations the apprehension may be considered as a disease for which there can be found no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the mode of appointment of the chief magistrate of the united states is almost the only part of the system of any consequence which has escaped without severe censure or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents the most plausible of these who has appeared in print has even deigned to admit that the election of the president is pretty well guarded.1 i venture somewhat further and hesitate not to affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect it is at least excellent it unites in an eminent degree all the advantages the union of which was to be wished for,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided this end will be answered by committing the right of making it not to any preestablished body but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose and at the particular conjuncture,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ."
<bos> it was equally desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice a small number of persons selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder this evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the president of the united states but the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration promise an effectual security against this mischief the choice of several to form an intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes and as the electors chosen in each state are to assemble and vote in the state in which they are chosen this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments which might be communicated from them to the people than if they were all to be convened at one time in one place,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal intrigue and corruption these most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one querter but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils how could they better gratify this than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union but the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention they have not made the appointment of the president to depend on any preexisting bodies of men who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of america to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment and they have excluded from eligibility to this trust all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office no senator representative or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the united states can be of the numbers of the electors thus without corrupting the body of the people the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias their transient existence and their detached situation already taken notice of afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so to the conclusion of it the business of corruption when it is to embrace so considerable a number of men requires time as well as means nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them dispersed as they would be over thirteen states in any combinations founded upon motives which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> another and no less important desideratum was that the executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all but the people themselves he might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration of his official consequence this advantage will also be secured by making his re-election to depend on a special body of representatives deputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important choice,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> all these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the convention which is that the people of each state shall choose a number of persons as electors equal to the number of senators and representatives of such state in the national government who shall assemble within the state and vote for some fit person as president their votes thus given are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the president but as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre in one man and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive it is provided that in such a contingency the house of representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have the five highest number of votes the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O , O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the process of election affords a moral certainty that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole union or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of president of the united states it will not be too strong to say that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent for ability and virtue and this will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the constitution by those who are able to estimate the share which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration though we can not acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says `` for forms of government let fools contest that which is best administered is best '' yet we may safely pronounce that the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the vice-president is to be chosen in the same manner with the president with this difference that the senate is to do in respect to the former what is to be done by the house of representatives in respect to the latter,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ."
<bos> the appointment of an extraordinary person as vice-president has been objected to as superfluous if not mischievous it has been alleged that it would have been preferable to have authorized the senate to elect out of their own body an officer answering that description but two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect one is that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the body it is necessary that the president should have only a casting vote and to take the senator of any state from his seat as senator to place him in that of president of the senate would be to exchange in regard to the state from which he came a constant for a contingent vote the other consideration is that as the vice-president may occasionally become a substitute for the president in the supreme executive magistracy all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one apply with great if not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other it is remarkable that in this as in most other instances the objection which is made would lie against the constitution of this state we have a lieutenant-governor chosen by the people at large who presides in the senate and is the constitutional substitute for the governor in casualties similar to those which would authorize the vice-president to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the president,"O O O O O O , O , O O O O O , O O .

<bos> to the powers proposed to be conferred upon the federal government in respect to the creation and direction of the national forces i have met with but one specific objection which if i understand it right is this that proper provision has not been made against the existence of standing armies in time of peace an objection which i shall now endeavor to show rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> it has indeed been brought forward in the most vague and general form supported only by bold assertions without the appearance of argument without even the sanction of theoretical opinions in contradiction to the practice of other free nations and to the general sense of america as expressed in most of the existing constitutions the proprietory of this remark will appear the moment it is recollected that the objection under consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the legislative authority of the nation in the article of military establishments a principle unheard of except in one or two of our state constitutions and rejected in all the rest,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> a stranger to our politics who was to read our newspapers at the present juncture without having previously inspected the plan reported by the convention would be naturally led to one of two conclusions either that it contained a positive injunction that standing armies should be kept up in time of peace or that it vested in the executive the whole power of levying troops without subjecting his discretion in any shape to the control of the legislature,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> if he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself he would be surprised to discover that neither the one nor the other was the case that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in the legislature not in the executive that this legislature was to be a popular body consisting of the representatives of the people periodically elected and that instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing armies there was to be found in respect to this object an important qualification even of the legislative discretion in that clause which forbids the appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer period than two years a precaution which upon a nearer view of it will appear to be a great and real security against the keeping up of troops without evident necessity,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> disappointed in his first surmise the person i have supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further he would naturally say to himself it is impossible that all this vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable pretext it must needs be that this people so jealous of their liberties have in all the preceding models of the constitutions which they have established inserted the most precise and rigid precautions on this point the omission of which in the new plan has given birth to all this apprehension and clamor,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> if under this impression he proceeded to pass in review the several state constitutions how great would be his disappointment to find that two only of them1 contained an interdiction of standing armies in time of peace that the other eleven had either observed a profound silence on the subject or had in express terms admitted the right of the legislature to authorize their existence,"O , O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> still however he would be persuaded that there must be some plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head he would never be able to imagine while any source of information remained unexplored that it was nothing more than an experiment upon the public credulity dictated either by a deliberate intention to deceive or by the overflowings of a zeal too intemperate to be ingenuous it would probably occur to him that he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in the primitive compact between the states here at length he would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma no doubt he would observe to himself the existing confederation must contain the most explicit provisions against military establishments in time of peace and a departure from this model in a favorite point has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence these political champions,"O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if he should now apply himself to a careful and critical survey of the articles of confederation his astonishment would not only be increased but would acquire a mixture of indignation at the unexpected discovery that these articles instead of containing the prohibition he looked for and though they had with jealous circumspection restricted the authority of the state legislatures in this particular had not imposed a single restraint on that of the united states if he happened to be a man of quick sensibility or ardent temper he could now no longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from all sincere lovers of their country how else he would say could the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures upon that plan about a point in which it seems to have conformed itself to the general sense of america as declared in its different forms of government and in which it has even superadded a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them if on the contrary he happened to be a man of calm and dispassionate feelings he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature and would lament that in a matter so interesting to the happiness of millions the true merits of the question should be perplexed and entangled by expedients so unfriendly to an impartial and right determination even such a man could hardly forbear remarking that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance of an intention to mislead the people by alarming their passions rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their understandings,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but however little this objection may be countenanced even by precedents among ourselves it may be satisfactory to take a nearer view of its intrinsic merits from a close examination it will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature in respect to military establishments in time of peace would be improper to be imposed and if imposed from the necessities of society would be unlikely to be observed,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> though a wide ocean separates the united states from europe yet there are various considerations that warn us against an excess of confidence or security on one side of us and stretching far into our rear are growing settlements subject to the dominion of britain on the other side and extending to meet the british settlements are colonies and establishments subject to the dominion of spain this situation and the vicinity of the west india islands belonging to these two powers create between them in respect to their american possessions and in relation to us a common interest the savage tribes on our western frontier ought to be regarded as our natural enemies their natural allies because they have most to fear from us and most to hope from them the improvements in the art of navigation have as to the facility of communication rendered distant nations in a great measure neighbors britain and spain are among the principal maritime powers of europe a future concert of views between these nations ought not to be regarded as improbable the increasing remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of the family compact between france and spain and politicians have ever with great reason considered the ties of blood as feeble and precarious links of political connection these circumstances combined admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering ourselves as entirely out of the reach of danger,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> previous to the revolution and ever since the peace there has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on our western frontier no person can doubt that these will continue to be indispensable if it should only be against the ravages and depredations of the indians these garrisons must either be furnished by occasional detachments from the militia or by permanent corps in the pay of the government the first is impracticable and if practicable would be pernicious the militia would not long if at all submit to be dragged from their occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in times of profound peace and if they could be prevailed upon or compelled to do it the increased expense of a frequent rotation of service and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the industrious pursuits of individuals would form conclusive objections to the scheme it would be as burdensome and injurious to the public as ruinous to private citizens the latter resource of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a standing army in time of peace a small one indeed but not the less real for being small here is a simple view of the subject that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional interdiction of such establishments and the necessity of leaving the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature,"O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in proportion to our increase in strength it is probable nay it may be said certain that britain and spain would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood if we should not be willing to be exposed in a naked and defenseless condition to their insults and encroachments we should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in some ratio to the force by which our western settlements might be annoyed there are and will be particular posts the possession of which will include the command of large districts of territory and facilitate future invasions of the remainder it may be added that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the indian nations can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two neighboring and formidable powers to act this part would be to desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy,"O O O O O O O , O O , , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we mean to be a commercial people or even to be secure on our atlantic side we must endeavor as soon as possible to have a navy to this purpose there must be dock-yards and arsenals and for the defense of these fortifications and probably garrisons when a nation has become so powerful by sea that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets this supersedes the necessity of garrisons for that purpose but where naval establishments are in their infancy moderate garrisons will in all likelihood be found an indispensable security against descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards and sometimes of the fleet itself,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O , O O O .

<bos> it has been urged in different shapes that a constitution of the kind proposed by the convention can not operate without the aid of a military force to execute its laws this however like most other things that have been alleged on that side rests on mere general assertion unsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the reasons upon which it is founded as far as i have been able to divine the latent meaning of the objectors it seems to originate in a presupposition that the people will be disinclined to the exercise of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature waiving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and external let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that disinclination in the people unless we presume at the same time that the powers of the general government will be worse administered than those of the state government there seems to be no room for the presumption of ill-will disaffection or opposition in the people i believe it may be laid down as a general rule that their confidence in and obedience to a government will commonly be proportioned to the goodness or badness of its administration it must be admitted that there are exceptions to this rule but these exceptions depend so entirely on accidental causes that they can not be considered as having any relation to the intrinsic merits or demerits of a constitution these can only be judged of by general principles and maxims,"O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> various reasons have been suggested in the course of these papers to induce a probability that the general government will be better administered than the particular governments the principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres of election will present a greater option or latitude of choice to the people that through the medium of the state legislatures which are select bodies of men and which are to appoint the members of the national senate there is reason to expect that this branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and judgment that these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more extensive information in the national councils and that they will be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction and more out of the reach of those occasional ill-humors or temporary prejudices and propensities which in smaller societies frequently contaminate the public councils beget injustice and oppression of a part of the community and engender schemes which though they gratify a momentary inclination or desire terminate in general distress dissatisfaction and disgust several additional reasons of considerable force to fortify that probability will occur when we come to survey with a more critical eye the interior structure of the edifice which we are invited to erect it will be sufficient here to remark that until satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion that the federal government is likely to be administered in such a manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people there can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws of the union will meet with any greater obstruction from them or will stand in need of any other methods to enforce their execution than the laws of the particular members,"O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , , O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O , , O .

<bos> the hope of impunity is a strong incitement to sedition the dread of punishment a proportionably strong discouragement to it will not the government of the union which if possessed of a due degree of power can call to its aid the collective resources of the whole confederacy be more likely to repress the former sentiment and to inspire the latter than that of a single state which can only command the resources within itself a turbulent faction in a state may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends to the government in that state but it can hardly be so infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts of the union if this reflection be just there is less danger of resistance from irregular combinations of individuals to the authority of the confederacy than to that of a single member,"O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> i will in this place hazard an observation which will not be the less just because to some it may appear new which is that the more the operations of the national authority are intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government the more the citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences of their political life the more it is familiarized to their sight and to their feelings the further it enters into those objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the most active springs of the human heart the greater will be the probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of the community man is very much a creature of habit a thing that rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence upon his mind a government continually at a distance and out of sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the people the inference is that the authority of the union and the affections of the citizens towards it will be strengthened rather than weakened by its extension to what are called matters of internal concern and will have less occasion to recur to force in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of its agency the more it circulates through those channls and currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow the less will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of compulsion,"O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> one thing at all events must be evident that a government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid the necessity of using force than that species of league contend for by most of its opponents the authority of which should only operate upon the states in their political or collective capacities it has been shown that in such a confederacy there can be no sanction for the laws but force that frequent delinquencies in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the government and that as often as these happen they can only be redressed if at all by war and violence,"O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the plan reported by the convention by extending the authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the several states will enable the government to employ the ordinary magistracy of each in the execution of its laws it is easy to perceive that this will tend to destroy in the common apprehension all distinction between the sources from which they might proceed and will give the federal government the same advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is enjoyed by the government of each state in addition to the influence on public opinion which will result from the important consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and support the resources of the whole union it merits particular attention in this place that the laws of the confederacy as to the enumerated and legitimate objects of its jurisdiction will become the supreme law of the land to the observance of which all officers legislative executive and judicial in each state will be bound by the sanctity of an oath thus the legislatures courts and magistrates of the respective members will be incorporated into the operations of the national government as far as its just and constitutional authority extends and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of its laws.1 any man who will pursue by his own reflections the consequences of this situation will perceive that there is good ground to calculate upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the union if its powers are administered with a common share of prudence if we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary we may deduce any inferences we please from the supposition for it is certainly possible by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the best government that ever was or ever can be instituted to provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses but though the adversaries of the proposed constitution should presume that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of public good or to the obligations of duty i would still ask them how the interests of ambition or the views of encroachment can be promoted by such a conduct,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> in disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary truths or first principles upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend these contain an internal evidence which antecedent to all reflection or combination commands the assent of the mind where it produces not this effect it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the organs of perception or from the influence of some strong interest or passion or prejudice of this nature are the maxims in geometry that `` the whole is greater than its part things equal to the same are equal to one another two straight lines can not enclose a space and all right angles are equal to each other '' of the same nature are these other maxims in ethics and politics that there can not be an effect without a cause that the means ought to be proportioned to the end that every power ought to be commensurate with its object that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation and there are other truths in the two latter sciences which if they can not pretend to rank in the class of axioms are yet such direct inferences from them and so obvious in themselves and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common-sense that they challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind with a degree of force and conviction almost equally irresistible,"O O O O O , O O O O , O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> the objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely abstracted from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the unruly passions of the human heart that mankind without difficulty adopt not only the more simple theorems of the science but even those abstruse paradoxes which however they may appear susceptible of demonstration are at variance with the natural conceptions which the mind without the aid of philosophy would be led to entertain upon the subject the infinite divisibility of matter or in other words the infinite divisibility of a finite thing extending even to the minutest atom is a point agreed among geometricians though not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of those mysteries in religion against which the batteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> but in the sciences of morals and politics men are found far less tractable to a certain degree it is right and useful that this should be the case caution and investigation are a necessary armor against error and imposition but this untractableness may be carried too far and may degenerate into obstinacy perverseness or disingenuity though it can not be pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge have in general the same degree of certainty with those of the mathematics yet they have much better claims in this respect than to judge from the conduct of men in particular situations we should be disposed to allow them the obscurity is much oftener in the passions and prejudices of the reasoner than in the subject men upon too many occasions do not give their own understandings fair play but yielding to some untoward bias they entangle themselves in words and confound themselves in subtleties,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> how else could it happen if we admit the objectors to be sincere in their opposition that positions so clear as those which manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the government of the union should have to encounter any adversaries among men of discernment though these positions have been elsewhere fully stated they will perhaps not be improperly recapitulated in this place as introductory to an examination of what may have been offered by way of objection to them they are in substance as follows,"O O O O O ( O O O O O O O O O O ) O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> as the duties of superintending the national defense and of securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which no possible limits can be assigned the power of making that provision ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the resources of the community,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as revenue is the essential engine by which the means of answering the national exigencies must be procured the power of procuring that article in its full extent must necessarily be comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing when exercised over the states in their collective capacities the federal government must of necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> did not experience evince the contrary it would be natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national government might safely be permitted to rest on the evidence of these propositions unassisted by any additional arguments or illustrations but we find in fact that the antagonists of the proposed constitution so far from acquiescing in their justness or truth seem to make their principal and most zealous effort against this part of the plan it may therefore be satisfactory to analyze the arguments with which they combat it,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> those of them which have been most labored with that view seem in substance to amount to this `` it is not true because the exigencies of the union may not be susceptible of limitation that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined revenue is as requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those of the union and the former are at least of equal importance with the latter to the happiness of the people it is therefore as necessary that the state governments should be able to command the means of supplying their wants as that the national government should possess the like faculty in respect to the wants of the union but an indefinite power of taxation in the latter might and probably would in time deprive the former of the means of providing for their own necessities and would subject them entirely to the mercy of the national legislature as the laws of the union are to become the supreme law of the land as it is to have power to pass all laws that may be necessary for carrying into execution the authorities with which it is proposed to vest it the national government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for state objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own it might allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy to the national revenues and thus all the resources of taxation might by degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly to the entire exclusion and destruction of the state governments '',"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O : O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon the supposition of usurpation in the national government at other times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the constitutional operation of its intended powers it is only in the latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to fairness the moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the federal government we get into an unfathomable abyss and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the union it is easy to imagine an endless train of possible dangers and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution i repeat here what i have observed in substance in another place that all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government not to the nature or extent of its powers the state governments by their original constitutions are invested with complete sovereignty in what does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter doubtless in the manner of their formation and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people if the proposed construction of the federal government be found upon an impartial examination of it to be such as to afford to a proper extent the same species of security all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be discarded,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it should not be forgotten that a disposition in the state governments to encroach upon the rights of the union is quite as probable as a disposition in the union to encroach upon the rights of the state governments what side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict must depend on the means which the contending parties could employ toward insuring success as in republics strength is always on the side of the people and as there are weighty reasons to induce a belief that the state governments will commonly possess most influence over them the natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end to the disadvantage of the union and that there is greater probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head than by the federal head upon the members but it is evident that all conjectures of this kind must be extremely vague and fallible and that it is by far the safest course to lay them altogether aside and to confine our attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the constitution every thing beyond this must be left to the prudence and firmness of the people who as they will hold the scales in their own hands it is to be hoped will always take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the general and the state governments upon this ground which is evidently the true one it will not be difficult to obviate the objections which have been made to an indefinite power of taxation in the united states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> next to permanency in office nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support the remark made in relation to the president is equally applicable here in the general course of human nature a power over a man 's subsistence amounts to a power over his will and we can never hope to see realized in practice the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter the enlightened friends to good government in every state have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the state constitutions on this head some of these indeed have declared that permanent1 salaries should be established for the judges but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite the plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of the united states `` shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office '',"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this all circumstances considered is the most eligible provision that could have been devised it will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the constitution inadmissible what might be extravagant to-day might in half a century become penurious and inadequate it was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse a man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation the clause which has been quoted combines both advantages the salaries of judicial officers may from time to time be altered as occasion shall require yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office in respect to him it will be observed that a difference has been made by the convention between the compensation of the president and of the judges that of the former can neither be increased nor diminished that of the latter can only not be diminished this probably arose from the difference in the duration of the respective offices as the president is to be elected for no more than four years it can rarely happen that an adequate salary fixed at the commencement of that period will not continue to be such to its end but with regard to the judges who if they behave properly will be secured in their places for life it may well happen especially in the early stages of the government that a stipend which would be very sufficient at their first appointment would become too small in the progress of their service,"O , O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy and it may be safely affirmed that together with the permanent tenure of their offices it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the states in regard to their own judges,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments they are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the house of representatives and tried by the senate and if convicted may be dismissed from office and disqualified for holding any other this is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character and is the only one which we find in our own constitution in respect to our own judges,"O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ; , O , O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the want of a provision for removing the judges on account of inability has been a subject of complaint but all considerate men will be sensible that such a provision would either not be practiced upon or would be more liable to abuse than calculated to answer any good purpose the mensuration of the faculties of the mind has i believe no place in the catalogue of known arts an attempt to fix the boundary between the regions of ability and inability would much oftener give scope to personal and party attachments and enmities than advance the interests of justice or the public good the result except in the case of insanity must for the most part be arbitrary and insanity without any formal or express provision may be safely pronounced to be a virtual disqualification,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the constitution of new york to avoid investigations that must forever be vague and dangerous has taken a particular age as the criterion of inability no man can be a judge beyond sixty i believe there are few at present who do not disapprove of this provision there is no station in relation to which it is less proper than to that of a judge the deliberating and comparing faculties generally preserve their strength much beyond that period in men who survive it and when in addition to this circumstance we consider how few there are who outlive the season of intellectual vigor and how improbable it is that any considerable portion of the bench whether more or less numerous should be in such a situation at the same time we shall be ready to conclude that limitations of this sort have little to recommend them in a republic where fortunes are not affluent and pensions not expedient the dismission of men from stations in which they have served their country long and usefully on which they depend for subsistence and from which it will be too late to resort to any other occupation for a livelihood ought to have some better apology to humanity than is to be found in the imaginary danger of a superannuated bench,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the objection to the plan of the convention which has met with most success in this state and perhaps in several of the other states is that relative to the want of a constitutional provision for the trial by jury in civil cases the disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan the mere silence of the constitution in regard to civil causes is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal extending not only to every species of civil but even to criminal causes to argue with respect to the latter would however be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the existence of matter or to demonstrate any of those propositions which by their own internal evidence force conviction when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> with regard to civil causes subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only not provided for is entirely abolished every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between silence and abolition but as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain legal maxims of interpretation which they have perverted from their true meaning it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the maxims on which they rely are of this nature `` a specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals '' or `` the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another '' hence say they as the constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases and is silent in respect to civil this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter,"O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O . O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the rules of legal interpretation are rules of commonsense adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws the true test therefore of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which they are derived this being the case let me ask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries is a privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other cases is it natural to suppose that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another which there was a previous power to do and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done if such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable it can not be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial and consequently if nothing was said in the constitution on the subject of juries the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone this discretion in regard to criminal causes is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases but it is of course left at large in relation to civil causes there being a total silence on this head the specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes but does not abridge the power of the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought proper the pretense therefore that the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries is a pretense destitute of all just foundation,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> from these observations this conclusion results that the trial by jury in civil cases would not be abolished and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted is contrary to reason and common-sense and therefore not admissible even if these maxims had a precise technical sense corresponding with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion which however is not the case they would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government in relation to such a subject the natural and obvious sense of its provisions apart from any technical rules is the true criterion of construction,"O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , , , O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning this will be best done by examples the plan of the convention declares that the power of congress or in other words of the national legislature shall extend to certain enumerated cases this specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd as well as useless if a general authority was intended,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> in like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified the expression of those cases marks the precise limits beyond which the federal courts can not extend their jurisdiction because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> these examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned and to designate the manner in which they should be used but that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject i shall add one case more to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims and the abuse which has been made of them,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> let us suppose that by the laws of this state a married woman was incapable of conveying her estate and that the legislature considering this as an evil should enact that she might dispose of her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate in such a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance because the woman having no previous power to alienate her property the specification determines the particular mode which she is for that purpose to avail herself of but let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations signified by their signing the deed could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value the position is too absurd to merit a refutation and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished because it is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> from these observations it must appear unquestionably true that trial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed constitution and it is equally true that in those controversies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be interested that institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is placed by the state constitutions and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration the foundation of this assertion is that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them and of course they will remain determinable as heretofore by the state courts only and in the manner which the state constitutions and laws prescribe all land causes except where claims under the grants of different states come into question and all other controversies between the citizens of the same state unless where they depend upon positive violations of the articles of union by acts of the state legislatures will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the state tribunals add to this that admiralty causes and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury and the inference from the whole will be that this institution as it exists with us at present can not possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention if they agree in nothing else concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury or if there is any difference between them it consists in this the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government for my own part the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation the more reason i have discovered for holding it in high estimation and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic or how much more merit it may be entitled to as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution and of its friendly aspect to liberty but i must acknowledge that i can not readily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty and the trial by jury in civil cases arbitrary impeachments arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism and these have all relation to criminal proceedings the trial by jury in criminal cases aided by the habeas-corpus act seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question and both of these are provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it has been observed that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation this observation deserves to be canvassed,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O ."
<bos> it is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature in regard to the amount of taxes to be laid to the objects upon which they are to be imposed or to the rule by which they are to be apportioned if it can have any influence therefore it must be upon the mode of collection and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as to the mode of collection in this state under our own constitution the trial by jury is in most cases out of use the taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale as in cases of rent and it is acknowledged on all hands that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws the dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens it would often occasion an accumulation of costs more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> and as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue the provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases will afford the security aimed at wilful abuses of a public authority to the oppression of the subject and every species of official extortion are offenses against the government for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and punished according to the circumstances of the case,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty the strongest argument in its favor is that it is a security against corruption as there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter the force of this consideration is however diminished by others the sheriff who is the summoner of ordinary juries and the clerks of courts who have the nomination of special juries are themselves standing officers and acting individually may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges who are a collective body it is not difficult to see that it would be in the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench in the next place it may fairly be supposed that there would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from the public mass than in gaining men who had been chosen by the government for their probity and good character but making every deduction for these considerations the trial by jury must still be a valuable check upon corruption it greatly multiplies the impediments to its success as matters now stand it would be necessary to corrupt both court and jury for where the jury have gone evidently wrong the court will generally grant a new trial and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the jury unless the court could be likewise gained here then is a double security and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions by increasing the obstacles to success it discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either the temptations to prostitution which the judges might have to surmount must certainly be much fewer while the co-operation of a jury is necessary than they might be if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all causes,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , , O O .

<bos> notwithstanding therefore the doubts i have expressed as to the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty i admit that it is in most cases under proper regulations an excellent method of determining questions of property and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended there is however in all cases great difficulty in this and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other that difficulty must be not a little augmented for my own part at every new view i take of the subject i become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles which we are authoritatively informed prevented the insertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention,"O , , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different states is not generally understood and as it must have considerable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained of in regard to this point an explanation of it is necessary in this state our judicial establishments resemble more nearly than in any other those of great britain we have courts of common law courts of probates analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in england a court of admiralty and a court of chancery in the courts of common law only the trial by jury prevails and this with some exceptions in all the others a single judge presides and proceeds in general either according to the course of the canon or civil law without the aid of a jury.1 in new jersey there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates in the sense in which these last are established with us in that state the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes which with us are determinable in the courtsof admiralty and of probates and of course the jury trial is more extensive in new jersey than in new york in pennsylvania this is perhaps still more the case for there is no court of chancery in that state and its common-law courts have equity jurisdiction it has a court of admiralty but none of probates at least on the plan of ours delaware has in these respects imitated pennsylvania maryland approaches more nearly to new york as does also virginia except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors north carolina bears most affinity to pennsylvania south carolina to virginia i believe however that in some of those states which have distinct courts of admiralty the causes depending in them are triable by juries in georgia there are none but common-law courts and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another which is called a special jury and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out in connecticut they have no distinct courts either of chancery or of admiralty and their courts of probates have no jurisdiction of causes their common-law courts have admiralty and to a certain extent equity jurisdiction in cases of importance their general assembly is the only court of chancery in connecticut therefore the trial by jury extends in practice further than in any other state yet mentioned rhode island is i believe in this particular pretty much in the situation of connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire in regard to the blending of law equity and admiralty jurisdictions are in a similar predicament in the four eastern states the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other states but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown in its full extent to any of them there is an appeal of course from one jury to another till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> from this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases in the several states and from this fact these obvious reflections flow first that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of all the states and secondly that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by taking the system of any one state for a standard as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the matter as has been done to legislative regulation,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O : , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O ."
<bos> the propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing the minority of pennsylvania have proposed this mode of expression for the purpose `` trial by jury shall be as heretofore '' and this i maintain would be senseless and nugatory the united states in their united or collective capacity are the object to which all general provisions in the constitution must necessarily be construed to refer now it is evident that though trial by jury with various limitations is known in each state individually yet in the united states as such it is at this time altogether unknown because the present federal government has no judiciary power whatever and consequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to which the term heretofore could relate it would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning and inoperative from its uncertainty,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as on the one hand the form of the provision would not fulfil the intent of its proposers so on the other if i apprehend that intent rightly it would be in itself inexpedient i presume it to be that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury if in the state where the courts sat that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case in the state courts that is to say admiralty causes should be tried in connecticut by a jury in new york without one the capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases under the same government is of itself sufficient to indispose every wellregulated judgment towards it whether the cause should be tried with or without a jury would depend in a great number of cases on the accidental situation of the court and parties,"O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> but this is not in my estimation the greatest objection i feel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one i think it so particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign nations that is in most cases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations of this nature among others are all prize causes juries can not be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries there would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their decisions so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war though the proper province of juries be to determine matters of fact yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable,"O O O O , O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O , O O O .

<bos> it will add great weight to this remark in relation to prize causes to mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of europe and that pursuant to such treaties they are determinable in great britain in the last resort before the king himself in his privy council where the fact as well as the law undergoes a re-examination this alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the constitution which would make the state systems a standard for the national government in the article under consideration and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O , O O .

<bos> my convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction and that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries the great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases which are exceptions2 to general rules to unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction must have a tendency to unsettle the general rules and to subject every case that arises to a special determination while a separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other and of keeping each within the expedient limits besides this the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are in many instances so nice and intricate that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury they require often such long deliberate and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them the simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the english system of jurisprudence which is the model that has been followed in several of the states but it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in which they have been united and the separation is essential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine purity the nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law but it is not a little to be suspected that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery on the plan upon which they are established in this state but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law and to undermine the trial by jury by introducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> these appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the systems of all the states in the formation of the national judiciary according to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the pennsylvania minority let us now examine how far the proposition of massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it is in this form `` in civil actions between citizens of different states every issue of fact arising in actions at common law may be tried by a jury if the parties or either of them request it '',"O O O O O : O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O"
<bos> this at best is a proposition confined to one description of causes and the inference is fair either that the massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal causes in which the trial by jury would be proper or that if desirous of a more extensive provision they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end if the first the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material imperfection in the system if the last it affords a strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing,"O , O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but this is not all if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several states of the union and the different powers exercised by them it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize that species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury in this state the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in england upon that subject in many of the other states the boundaries are less precise in some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law to be determined by a jury if the parties or either of them choose it hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition that i have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the pennsylvania minority in one state a cause would receive its determination from a jury if the parties or either of them requested it but in another state a cause exactly similar to the other must be decided without the intervention of a jury because the state judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction,"O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is obvious therefore that the massachusetts proposition upon this subject can not operate as a general regulation until some uniform plan with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions shall be adopted by the different states to devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself and which it would require much time and reflection to mature it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the states in the union or that would perfectly quadrate with the several state institutions,"O O O , , O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it may be asked why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this state taking that which is allowed by me to be a good one as a standard for the united states i answer that it is not very probable the other states would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves it is natural to suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own and that each would struggle for the preference if the plan of taking one state as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government and it must be uncertain which of the states would have been taken as the model it has been shown that many of them would be improper ones and i leave it to conjecture whether under all circumstances it is most likely that new york or some other state would have been preferred but admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other states at the partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one the enemies of the plan would have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it which perhaps might have hazarded in no inconsiderable degree its final establishment,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O ."
<bos> to avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to embrace it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers that a provision might have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever for this i believe no precedent is to be found in any member of the union and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of pennsylvania must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in all cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> in short the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose or too much to be advisable or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> i can not but persuade myself on the other hand that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point they have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases and those in which the great body of the community is interested that mode of trial will remain in its full force as established in the state constitutions untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention that it is in no case abolished3 by that plan and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a constitution for the united states,"O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails for my part i acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this state it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply and might as advantageously be abridged in others it is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases the examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits as well in these states as in great britain afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions i suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this is now clearly understood to be the case in great britain and it is equally so in the state of connecticut and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this state since the revolution though provided for by a positive article of our constitution than has happened in the same time either in connecticut or great britain it may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career the truth is that the general genius of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects particular provisions though not altogether useless have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them and the want of them will never be with men of sound discernment a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases because it does not do it in civil also while it is a notorious fact that connecticut which has been always regarded as the most popular state in the union can boast of no constitutional provision for either,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."

<bos> the president of the united states is to be `` commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the united states and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states '' the propriety of this provision is so evident in itself and it is at the same time so consonant to the precedents of the state constitutions in general that little need be said to explain or enforce it even those of them which have in other respects coupled the chief magistrate with a council have for the most part concentrated the military authority in him alone of all the cares or concerns of government the direction of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single hand the direction of war implies the direction of the common strength and the power of directing and employing the common strength forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> `` the president may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective officers '' this i consider as a mere redundancy in the plan as the right for which it provides would result of itself from the office,"O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> he is also to be authorized to grant `` reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states except in cases of impeachment '' humanity and good policy conspire to dictate that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as little as possible fettered or embarrassed the criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel as the sense of responsibility is always strongest in proportion as it is undivided it may be inferred that a single man would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for a mitigation of the rigor of the law and least apt to yield to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of its vengeance the reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature depended on his sole fiat would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance would beget equal circumspection though of a different kind on the other hand as men generally derive confidence from their numbers they might often encourage each other in an act of obduracy and might be less sensible to the apprehension of suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency on these accounts one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of the mercy of government than a body of men,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> the expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the president has if i mistake not been only contested in relation to the crime of treason this it has been urged ought to have depended upon the assent of one or both of the branches of the legislative body i shall not deny that there are strong reasons to be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of that body or of a part of it as treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender there seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legislature and this ought the rather to be the case as the supposition of the connivance of the chief magistrate ought not to be entirely excluded but there are also strong objections to such a plan it is not to be doubted that a single man of prudence and good sense is better fitted in delicate conjunctures to balance the motives which may plead for and against the remission of the punishment than any numerous body whatever it deserves particular attention that treason will often be connected with seditions which embrace a large proportion of the community as lately happened in massachusetts in every such case we might expect to see the representation of the people tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense and when parties were pretty equally matched the secret sympathy of the friends and favorers of the condemned person availing itself of the good-nature and weakness of others might frequently bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O . , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O .

<bos> on the other hand when the sedition had proceeded from causes which had inflamed the resentments of the major party they might often be found obstinate and inexorable when policy demanded a conduct of forbearance and clemency but the principal argument for reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the chief magistrate is this in seasons of insurrection or rebellion there are often critical moments when a welltimed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth and which if suffered to pass unimproved it may never be possible afterwards to recall the dilatory process of convening the legislature or one of its branches for the purpose of obtaining its sanction to the measure would frequently be the occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity the loss of a week a day an hour may sometimes be fatal if it should be observed that a discretionary power with a view to such contingencies might be occasionally conferred upon the president it may be answered in the first place that it is questionable whether in a limited constitution that power could be delegated by law and in the second place that it would generally be impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the prospect of impunity a proceeding of this kind out of the usual course would be likely to be construed into an argument of timidity or of weakness and would have a tendency to embolden guilt,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it was a thing hardly to be expected that in a popular revolution the minds of men should stop at that happy mean which marks the salutary boundary between power and privilege and combines the energy of government with the security of private rights a failure in this delicate and important point is the great source of the inconveniences we experience and if we are not cautious to avoid a repetition of the error in our future attempts to rectify and ameliorate our system we may travel from one chimerical project to another we may try change after change but we shall never be likely to make any material change for the better,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the idea of restraining the legislative authority in the means of providing for the national defense is one of those refinements which owe their origin to a zeal for liberty more ardent than enlightened we have seen however that it has not had thus far an extensive prevalency that even in this country where it made its first appearance pennsylvania and north carolina are the only two states by which it has been in any degree patronized and that all the others have refused to give it the least countenance wisely judging that confidence must be placed somewhere that the necessity of doing it is implied in the very act of delegating power and that it is better to hazard the abuse of that confidence than to embarrass the government and endanger the public safety by impolitic restrictions on the legislative authority the opponents of the proposed constitution combat in this respect the general decision of america and instead of being taught by experience the propriety of correcting any extremes into which we may have heretofore run they appear disposed to conduct us into others still more dangerous and more extravagant as if the tone of government had been found too high or too rigid the doctrines they teach are calculated to induce us to depress or to relax it by expedients which upon other occasions have been condemned or forborne it may be affirmed without the imputation of invective that if the principles they inculcate on various points could so far obtain as to become the popular creed they would utterly unfit the people of this country for any species of government whatever but a danger of this kind is not to be apprehended the citizens of america have too much discernment to be argued into anarchy and i am much mistaken if experience has not wrought a deep and solemn conviction in the public mind that greater energy of government is essential to the welfare and prosperity of the community,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may not be amiss in this place concisely to remark the origin and progress of the idea which aims at the exclusion of military establishments in time of peace though in speculative minds it may arise from a contemplation of the nature and tendency of such institutions fortified by the events that have happened in other ages and countries yet as a national sentiment it must be traced to those habits of thinking which we derive from the nation from whom the inhabitants of these states have in general sprung,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

"<bos> in england for a long time after the norman conquest the authority of the monarch was almost unlimited inroads were gradually made upon the prerogative in favor of liberty first by the barons and afterwards by the people till the greatest part of its most formidable pretensions became extinct but it was not till the revolution in 1688 which elevated the prince of orange to the throne of great britain that english liberty was completely triumphant as incident to the undefined power of making war an acknowledged prerogative of the crown charles ii had by his own authority kept on foot in time of peace a body of 5,000 regular troops and this number james ii increased to 30,000 who were paid out of his civil list at the revolution to abolish the exercise of so dangerous an authority it became an article of the bill of rights then framed that `` the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace unless with the consent of parliament was against law ''","O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> in that kingdom when the pulse of liberty was at its highest pitch no security against the danger of standing armies was thought requisite beyond a prohibition of their being raised or kept up by the mere authority of the executive magistrate the patriots who effected that memorable revolution were too temperate too wellinformed to think of any restraint on the legislative discretion they were aware that a certain number of troops for guards and garrisons were indispensable that no precise bounds could be set to the national exigencies that a power equal to every possible contingency must exist somewhere in the government and that when they referred the exercise of that power to the judgment of the legislature they had arrived at the ultimate point of precaution which was reconcilable with the safety of the community,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> from the same source the people of america may be said to have derived an hereditary impression of danger to liberty from standing armies in time of peace the circumstances of a revolution quickened the public sensibility on every point connected with the security of popular rights and in some instances raise the warmth of our zeal beyond the degree which consisted with the due temperature of the body politic the attempts of two of the states to restrict the authority of the legislature in the article of military establishments are of the number of these instances the principles which had taught us to be jealous of the power of an hereditary monarch were by an injudicious excess extended to the representatives of the people in their popular assemblies even in some of the states where this error was not adopted we find unnecessary declarations that standing armies ought not to be kept up in time of peace without the consent of the legislature i call them unnecessary because the reason which had introduced a similar provision into the english bill of rights is not applicable to any of the state constitutions the power of raising armies at all under those constitutions can by no construction be deemed to reside anywhere else than in the legislatures themselves and it was superfluous if not absurd to declare that a matter should not be done without the consent of a body which alone had the power of doing it accordingly in some of these constitutions and among others in that of this state of new york which has been justly celebrated both in europe and america as one of the best of the forms of government established in this country there is a total silence upon the subject,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> it is remarkable that even in the two states which seem to have meditated an interdiction of military establishments in time of peace the mode of expression made use of is rather cautionary than prohibitory it is not said that standing armies shall not be kept up but that they ought not to be kept up in time of peace this ambiguity of terms appears to have been the result of a conflict between jealousy and conviction between the desire of excluding such establishments at all events and the persuasion that an absolute exclusion would be unwise and unsafe,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> can it be doubted that such a provision whenever the situation of public affairs was understood to require a departure from it would be interpreted by the legislature into a mere admonition and would be made to yield to the necessities or supposed necessities of the state let the fact already mentioned with respect to pennsylvania decide what then it may be asked is the use of such a provision if it cease to operate the moment there is an inclination to disregard it,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> let us examine whether there be any comparison in point of efficacy between the provision alluded to and that which is contained in the new constitution for restraining the appropriations of money for military purposes to the period of two years the former by aiming at too much is calculated to effect nothing the latter by steering clear of an imprudent extreme and by being perfectly compatible with a proper provision for the exigencies of the nation will have a salutary and powerful operation,"O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the legislature of the united states will be obliged by this provision once at least in every two years to deliberate upon the propriety of keeping a military force on foot to come to a new resolution on the point and to declare their sense of the matter by a formal vote in the face of their constituents they are not at liberty to vest in the executive department permanent funds for the support of an army if they were even incautious enough to be willing to repose in it so improper a confidence as the spirit of party in different degrees must be expected to infect all political bodies there will be no doubt persons in the national legislature willing enough to arraign the measures and criminate the views of the majority the provision for the support of a military force will always be a favorable topic for declamation as often as the question comes forward the public attention will be roused and attracted to the subject by the party in opposition and if the majority should be really disposed to exceed the proper limits the community will be warned of the danger and will have an opportunity of taking measures to guard against it independent of parties in the national legislature itself as often as the period of discussion arrived the state legislatures who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers and will be ready enough if any thing improper appears to sound the alarm to the people and not only to be the voice but if necessary the arm of their discontent,"O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> schemes to subvert the liberties of a great community require time to mature them for execution an army so large as seriously to menace those liberties could only be formed by progressive augmentations which would suppose not merely a temporary combination between the legislature and executive but a continued conspiracy for a series of time is it probable that such a combination would exist at all is it probable that it would be persevered in and transmitted along through all the successive variations in a representative body which biennial elections would naturally produce in both houses is it presumable that every man the instant he took his seat in the national senate or house of representatives would commence a traitor to his constituents and to his country can it be supposed that there would not be found one man discerning enough to detect so atrocious a conspiracy or bold or honest enough to apprise his constituents of their danger if such presumptions can fairly be made there ought at once to be an end of all delegated authority the people should resolve to recall all the powers they have heretofore parted with out of their own hands and to divide themselves into as many states as there are counties in order that they may be able to manage their own concerns in person,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if such suppositions could even be reasonably made still the concealment of the design for any duration would be impracticable it would be announced by the very circumstance of augmenting the army to so great an extent in time of profound peace what colorable reason could be assigned in a country so situated for such vast augmentations of the military force it is impossible that the people could be long deceived and the destruction of the project and of the projectors would quickly follow the discovery,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O , O O .

<bos> it has been said that the provision which limits the appropriation of money for the support of an army to the period of two years would be unavailing because the executive when once possessed of a force large enough to awe the people into submission would find resources in that very force sufficient to enable him to dispense with supplies from the acts of the legislature but the question again recurs upon what pretense could he be put in possession of a force of that magnitude in time of peace if we suppose it to have been created in consequence of some domestic insurrection or foreign war then it becomes a case not within the principles of the objection for this is levelled against the power of keeping up troops in time of peace few persons will be so visionary as seriously to contend that military forces ought not to be raised to quell a rebellion or resist an invasion and if the defense of the community under such circumstances should make it necessary to have an army so numerous as to hazard its liberty this is one of those calamaties for which there is neither preventative nor cure it can not be provided against by any possible form of government it might even result from a simple league offensive and defensive if it should ever be necessary for the confederates or allies to form an army for common defense,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but it is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than in a disunited state nay it may be safely asserted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter situation it is not easy to conceive a possibility that dangers so formidable can assail the whole union as to demand a force considerable enough to place our liberties in the least jeopardy especially if we take into our view the aid to be derived from the militia which ought always to be counted upon as a valuable and powerful auxiliary but in a state of disunion as has been fully shown in another place the contrary of this supposition would become not only probable but almost unavoidable,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the erection of a new government whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work can not fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety and these may in a particular manner be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties 't is time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system can liquidate the meaning of all the parts and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent whole,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> such questions accordingly have arisen upon the plan proposed by the convention and particularly concerning the judiciary department the principal of these respect the situation of the state courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction is this to be exclusive or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction if the latter in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals these are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense and which are certainly entitled to attention,"O O , , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the principles established in a former paper1 teach us that the states will retain all pre-existing authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases where an exclusive authority is in express terms granted to the union or where a particular authority is granted to the union and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the states or where an authority is granted to the union with which a similar authority in the states would be utterly incompatible though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power yet i am inclined to think that they are in the main just with respect to the former as well as the latter and under this impression i shall lay it down as a rule that the state courts will retain the jurisdiction they now have unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O , O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the only thing in the proposed constitution which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts is contained in this passage `` the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress shall from time to time ordain and establish '' this might either be construed to signify that the supreme and subordinate courts of the union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend or simply to denote that the organs of the national judiciary should be one supreme court and as many subordinate courts as congress should think proper to appoint or in other words that the united states should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested through one supreme tribunal and a certain number of inferior ones to be instituted by them the first excludes the last admits the concurrent jurisdiction of the state tribunals and as the first would amount to an alienation of state power by implication the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the state courts have previous cognizance it is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of and be peculiar to the constitution to be established for not to allow the state courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority i mean not therefore to contend that the united states in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely if such a measure should be deemed expedient but i hold that the state courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction further than may relate to an appeal and i am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth this i infer from the nature of judiciary power and from the general genius of the system the judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe those of japan not less than of new york may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts when in addition to this we consider the state governments and the national governments as they truly are in the light of kindred systems and as parts of one whole the inference seems to be conclusive that the state courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the union where it was not expressly prohibited,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> here another question occurs what relation would subsist between the national and state courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction i answer that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter to the supreme court of the united states the constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts the objects of appeal not the tribunals from which it is to be made are alone contemplated from this circumstance and from the reason of the thing it ought to be construed to extend to the state tribunals either this must be the case or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern else the judiciary authority of the union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor neither of these consequences ought without evident necessity to be involved the latter would be entirely inadmissible as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government and would essentially embarrass its measures nor do i perceive any foundation for such a supposition agreeably to the remark already made the national and state systems are to be regarded as one whole the courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the union and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions the evident aim of the plan of the convention is that all the causes of the specified classes shall for weighty public reasons receive their original or final determination in the courts of the union to confine therefore the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the supreme court to appeals from the subordinate federal courts instead of allowing their extension to the state courts would be to abridge the latitude of the terms in subversion of the intent contrary to every sound rule of interpretation,"O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> but could an appeal be made to lie from the state courts to the subordinate federal judicatories this is another of the questions which have been raised and of greater difficulty than the former the following considerations countenance the affirmative the plan of the convention in the first place authorizes the national legislature `` to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court `` 2 it declares in the next place that `` the judicial power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as congress shall ordain and establish '' and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial power shall extend it afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the supreme court into original and appellate but gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts the only outlines described for them are that they shall be `` inferior to the supreme court '' and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary whether their authority shall be original or appellate or both is not declared all this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature and this being the case i perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the state courts to the subordinate national tribunals and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined it would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court the state tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes and appeals in most cases in which they may be deemed proper instead of being carried to the supreme court may be made to lie from the state courts to district courts of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> the natural order of the subject leads us to consider in this place that provision of the constitution which authorizes the national legislature to regulate in the last resort the election of its own members it is in these words `` the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations except as to the places of choosing senators `` 1 this provision has not only been declaimed against by those who condemn the constitution in the gross but it has been censured by those who have objected with less latitude and greater moderation and in one instance it has been thought exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the advocate of every other part of the system i am greatly mistaken notwithstanding if there be any article in the whole plan more completely defensible than this its propriety rests upon the evidence of this plain proposition that every government ought to contain in itself the means of its own preservation every just reasoner will at first sight approve an adherence to this rule in the work of the convention and will disapprove every deviation from it which may not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating into the work some particular ingredient with which a rigid conformity to the rule was incompatible even in this case though he may acquiesce in the necessity yet he will not cease to regard and to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle as a portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of future weakness and perhaps anarchy,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> it will not be alleged that an election law could have been framed and inserted in the constitution which would have been always applicable to every probable change in the situation of the country and it will therefore not be denied that a discretionary power over elections ought to exist somewhere it will i presume be as readily conceded that there were only three ways in which this power could have been reasonably modified and disposed that it must either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature or wholly in the state legislatures or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former the last mode has with reason been preferred by the convention they have submitted the regulation of elections for the federal government in the first instance to the local administrations which in ordinary cases and when no improper views prevail may be both more convenient and more satisfactory but they have reserved to the national authority a right to interpose whenever extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition necessary to its safety nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national government in the hands of the state legislatures would leave the existence of the union entirely at their mercy they could at any moment annihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs it is to little purpose to say that a neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take place the constitutional possibility of the thing without an equivalent for the risk is an unanswerable objection nor has any satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that risk the extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be dignified with that character,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we are in a humor to presume abuses of power it is as fair to presume them on the part of the state governments as on the part of the general government and as it is more consonant to the rules of a just theory to trust the union with the care of its own existence than to transfer that care to any other hands if abuses of power are to be hazarded on the one side or on the other it is more rational to hazard them where the power would naturally be placed than where it would unnaturally be placed suppose an article had been introduced into the constitution empowering the united states to regulate the elections for the particular states would any man have hesitated to condemn it both as an unwarrantable transposition of power and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the state governments the violation of principle in this case would have required no comment and to an unbiased observer it will not be less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the national government in a similar respect to the pleasure of the state governments an impartial view of the matter can not fail to result in a conviction that each as far as possible ought to depend on itself for its own preservation,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as an objection to this position it may be remarked that the constitution of the national senate would involve in its full extent the danger which it is suggested might flow from an exclusive power in the state legislatures to regulate the federal elections it may be alleged that by declining the appointment of senators they might at any time give a fatal blow to the union and from this it may be inferred that as its existence would be thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point there can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the particular case under consideration the interest of each state it may be added to maintain its representation in the national councils would be a complete security against an abuse of the trust this argument though specious will not upon examination be found solid it is certainly true that the state legislatures by forbearing the appointment of senators may destroy the national government but it will not follow that because they have a power to do this in one instance they ought to have it in every other there are cases in which the pernicious tendency of such a power may be far more decisive without any motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated the conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the senate to recommend their admission into the system,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> so far as that construction may expose the union to the possibility of injury from the state legislatures it is an evil but it is an evil which could not have been avoided without excluding the states in their political capacities wholly from a place in the organization of the national government if this had been done it would doubtless have been interpreted into an entire dereliction of the federal principle and would certainly have deprived the state governments of that absolute safeguard which they will enjoy under this provision but however wise it may have been to have submitted in this instance to an inconvenience for the attainment of a necessary advantage or a greater good no inference can be drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil where no necessity urges nor any greater good invites it may be easily discerned also that the national government would run a much greater risk from a power in the state legislatures over the elections of its house of representatives than from their power of appointing the members of its senate the senators are to be chosen for the period of six years there is to be a rotation by which the seats of a third part of them are to be vacated and replenished every two years and no state is to be entitled to more than two senators a quorum of the body is to consist of sixteen members,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the joint result of these circumstances would be that a temporary combination of a few states to intermit the appointment of senators could neither annul the existence nor impair the activity of the body and it is not from a general and permanent combination of the states that we can have any thing to fear the first might proceed from sinister designs in the leading members of a few of the state legislatures the last would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the great body of the people which will either never exist at all or will in all probability proceed from an experience of the inaptitude of the general government to the advancement of their happiness in which event no good citizen could desire its continuance but with regard to the federal house of representatives there is intended to be a general election of members once in two years if the state legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the national situation which might issue in a dissolution of the union if the leaders of a few of the most important states should have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an election i shall not deny that there is a degree of weight in the observation that the interests of each state to be represented in the federal councils will be a security against the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of the state legislatures but the security will not be considered as complete by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between the interest of the people in the public felicity and the interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of their offices,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the people of america may be warmly attached to the government of the union at times when the particular rulers of particular states stimulated by the natural rivalship of power and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement and supported by a strong faction in each of those states may be in a very opposite temper this diversity of sentiment between a majority of the people and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their councils is exemplified in some of the states at the present moment on the present question the scheme of separate confederacies which will always nultiply the chances of ambition will be a never failing bait to all such influential characters in the state administrations as are capable of preferring their own emolument and advancement to the public weal with so effectual a weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating elections for the national government a combination of a few such men in a few of the most considerable states where the temptation will always be the strongest might accomplish the destruction of the union by seizing the opportunity of some casual dissatisfaction among the people and which perhaps they may themselves have excited to discontinue the choice of members for the federal house of representatives it ought never to be forgotten that a firm union of this country under an efficient government will probably be an increasing object of jealousy to more than one nation of europe and that enterprises to subvert it will sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers and will seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them its preservation therefore ought in no case that can be avoided to be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and vigilant performance of the trust,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> assuming it therefore as an established truth that the several states in case of disunion or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war of friendship and enmity with each other which have fallen to the lot of all neighboring nations not united under one government let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences that would attend such a situation,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> war between the states in the first period of their separate existence would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries where regular military establishments have long obtained the disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of europe though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and economy have notwithstanding been productive of the signal advantage of rendering sudden conquests impracticable and of preventing that rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war prior to their introduction the art of fortification has contributed to the same ends the nations of europe are encircled with chains of fortified places which mutually obstruct invasion campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons to gain admittance into an enemy 's country similar impediments occur at every step to exhaust the strength and delay the progress of an invader formerly an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighboring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops acting on the defensive with the aid of posts is able to impede and finally to frustrate the enterprises of one much more considerable the history of war in that quarter of the globe is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned but of towns taken and retaken of battles that decide nothing of retreats more beneficial than victories of much effort and little acquisition,"O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in this country the scene would be altogether reversed the jealousy of military establishments would postpone them as long as possible the want of fortifications leaving the frontiers of one state open to another would facilitate inroads the populous states would with little difficulty overrun their less populous neighbors conquests would be as easy to be made as difficult to be retained war therefore would be desultory and predatory plunder and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars the calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits,"O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this picture is not too highly wrought though i confess it would not long remain a just one safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct even the ardent love of liberty will after a time give way to its dictates the violent destruction of life and property incident to war the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights to be more safe they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free,"O O O O O O O ; , O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the institutions chiefly alluded to are standing armies and the correspondent appendages of military establishments standing armies it is said are not provided against in the new constitution and it is therefore inferred that they may exist under it.1 their existence however from the very terms of the proposition is at most problematical and uncertain but standing armies it may be replied must inevitably result from a dissolution of the confederacy frequent war and constant apprehension which require a state of as constant preparation will infallibly produce them the weaker states or confederacies would first have recourse to them to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbors they would endeavor to supply the inferiority of population and resources by a more regular and effective system of defense by disciplined troops and by fortifications they would at the same time be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy it is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the states or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors small states or states of less natural strength under vigorous governments and with the assistance of disciplined armies have often triumphed over large states or states of greater natural strength which have been destitute of these advantages neither the pride nor the safety of the more important states or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority they would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence thus we should in a little time see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the old world this at least would be the natural course of things and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may perhaps be asked by way of objection to this why did not standing armies spring up out of the contentions which so often distracted the ancient republics of greece different answers equally satisfactory may be given to this question the industrious habits of the people of the present day absorbed in the pursuits of gain and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers which was the true condition of the people of those republics the means of revenue which have been so greatly multiplied by the increase of gold and silver and of the arts of industry and the science of finance which is the offspring of modern times concurring with the habits of nations have produced an entire revolution in the system of war and have rendered disciplined armies distinct from the body of the citizens the inseparable companions of frequent hostility,"O O , , O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> there is a wide difference also between military establishments in a country seldom exposed by its situation to internal invasions and in one which is often subject to them and always apprehensive of them the rulers of the former can have a good pretext if they are even so inclined to keep on foot armies so numerous as must of necessity be maintained in the latter these armies being in the first case rarely if at all called into activity for interior defense the people are in no danger of being broken to military subordination the laws are not accustomed to relaxations in favor of military exigencies the civil state remains in full vigor neither corrupted nor confounded with the principles or propensities of the other state the smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an over-match for it and the citizens not habituated to look up to the military power for protection or to submit to its oppressions neither love nor fear the soldiery they view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights the army under such circumstances may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction or an occasional mob or insurrection but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> in a country in the predicament last described the contrary of all this happens the perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it its armies must be numerous enough for instant defense the continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen the military state becomes elevated above the civil the inhabitants of territories often the theatre of war are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights which serve to weaken their sense of those rights and by degrees the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors but as their superiors the transition from this disposition to that of considering them masters is neither remote nor difficult but it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions to make a bold or effectual resistance to usurpations supported by the military power,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the kingdom of great britain falls within the first description an insular situation and a powerful marine guarding it in a great measure against the possibility of foreign invasion supersede the necessity of a numerous army within the kingdom a sufficient force to make head against a sudden descent till the militia could have time to rally and embody is all that has been deemed requisite no motive of national policy has demanded nor would public opinion have tolerated a larger number of troops upon its domestic establishment there has been for a long time past little room for the operation of the other causes which have been enumerated as the consequences of internal war this peculiar felicity of situation has in a great degree contributed to preserve the liberty which that country to this day enjoys in spite of the prevalent venality and corruption if on the contrary britain had been situated on the continent and had been compelled as she would have been by that situation to make her military establishments at home coextensive with those of the other great powers of europe she like them would in all probability be at this day a victim to the absolute power of a single man 't is possible though not easy that the people of that island may be enslaved from other causes but it can not be by the prowess of an army so inconsiderable as that which has been usually kept up within the kingdom,"O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we are wise enough to preserve the union we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation europe is at a great distance from us her colonies in our vicinity will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance extensive military establishments can not in this position be necessary to our security but if we should be disunited and the integral parts should either remain separated or which is most probable should be thrown together into two or three confederacies we should be in a short course of time in the predicament of the continental powers of europe -- our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this is an idea not superficial or futile but solid and weighty it deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever party if such men will make a firm and solemn pause and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this interesting idea if they will contemplate it in all its attitudes and trace it to all its consequences they will not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a constitution the rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to the union the airy phantoms that flit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries would quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers real certain and formidable,"O O O O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> there is an idea which is not without its advocates that a vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government the enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation since they can never admit its truth without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government it is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition of faction and of anarchy every man the least conversant in roman story knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man under the formidable title of dictator as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of rome,"O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there can be no need however to multiply arguments or examples on this head a feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government a feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution and a government ill executed whatever it may be in theory must be in practice a bad government,"O O O O O , , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O , O , O , O O ."
<bos> taking it for granted therefore that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic executive it will only remain to inquire what are the ingredients which constitute this energy how far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense and how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention,"O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> the ingredients which constitute energy in the executive are first unity secondly duration thirdly an adequate provision for its support fourthly competent powers,"O O O O O O O O O , , ; , ; , O O O O O ; , O ."
<bos> the ingredients which constitute safety in the repub lican sense are first a due dependence on the people secondly a due responsibility,"O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O , , O O ."
<bos> those politicians and statesmen who have been the most celebrated for the soundness of their principles and for the justice of their views have declared in favor of a single executive and a numerous legislature they have with great propriety considered energy as the most necessary qualification of the former and have regarded this as most applicable to power in a single hand while they have with equal propriety considered the latter as best adapted to deliberation and wisdom and best calculated to conciliate the confidence of the people and to secure their privileges and interests,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> that unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed decision activity secrecy and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number and in proportion as the number is increased these qualities will be diminished,"O O O O O O O O O O . , , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O ."
<bos> this unity may be destroyed in two ways either by vesting the power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority or by vesting it ostensibly in one man subject in whole or in part to the control and co-operation of others in the capacity of counsellors to him of the first the two consuls of rome may serve as an example of the last we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the states new york and new jersey if i recollect right are the only states which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single men.1 both these methods of destroying the unity of the executive have their partisans but the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous they are both liable if not to equal to similar objections and may in most lights be examined in conjunction,"O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> the experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this head as far however as it teaches any thing it teaches us not to be enamoured of plurality in the executive we have seen that the achaeans on an experiment of two praetors were induced to abolish one the roman history records many instances of mischiefs to the republic from the dissensions between the consuls and between the military tribunes who were at times substituted for the consuls but it gives us no specimens of any peculiar advantages derived to the state from the circumstance of the plurality of those magistrates that the dissensions between them were not more frequent or more fatal is a matter of astonishment until we advert to the singular position in which the republic was almost continually placed and to the prudent policy pointed out by the circumstances of the state and pursued by the consuls of making a division of the government between them the patricians engaged in a perpetual struggle with the plebeians for the preservation of their ancient authorities and dignities the consuls who were generally chosen out of the former body were commonly united by the personal interest they had in the defense of the privileges of their order in addition to this motive of union after the arms of the republic had considerably expanded the bounds of its empire it became an established custom with the consuls to divide the administration between themselves by lot one of them remaining at rome to govern the city and its environs the other taking the command in the more distant provinces this expedient must no doubt have had great influence in preventing those collisions and rivalships which might otherwise have embroiled the peace of the republic,"O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but quitting the dim light of historical research attaching ourselves purely to the dictates of reason and good se se we shall discover much greater cause to reject than to approve the idea of plurality in the executive under any modification whatever,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> wherever two or more persons are engaged in any common enterprise or pursuit there is always danger of difference of opinion if it be a public trust or office in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority there is peculiar danger of personal emulation and even animosity from either and especially from all these causes the most bitter dissensions are apt to spring whenever these happen they lessen the respectability weaken the authority and distract the plans and operation of those whom they divide if they should unfortunately assail the supreme executive magistracy of a country consisting of a plurality of persons they might impede or frustrate the most important measures of the government in the most critical emergencies of the state and what is still worse they might split the community into the most violent and irreconcilable factions adhering differently to the different individuals who composed the magistracy,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency in planning it or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike but if they have been consulted and have happened to disapprove opposition then becomes in their estimation an indispensable duty of self-love they seem to think themselves bound in honor and by all the motives of personal infallibility to defeat the success of what has been resolved upon contrary to their sentiments men of upright benevolent tempers have too many opportunities of remarking with horror to what desperate lengths this disposition is sometimes carried and how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity to the conceit and to the obstinacy of individuals who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind perhaps the question now before the public may in its consequences afford melancholy proofs of the effects of this despicable frailty or rather detestable vice in the human character,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> upon the principles of a free government inconveniences from the source just mentioned must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature but it is unnecessary and therefore unwise to introduce them into the constitution of the executive it is here too that they may be most pernicious in the legislature promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit the differences of opinion and the jarrings of parties in that department of the government though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans yet often promote deliberation and circumspection and serve to check excesses in the majority when a resolution too is once taken the opposition must be at an end that resolution is a law and resistance to it punishable but no favorable circumstances palliate or atone for the disadvantages of dissension in the executive department here they are pure and unmixed there is no point at which they cease to operate they serve to embarrass and weaken the execution of the plan or measure to which they relate from the first step to the final conclusion of it they constantly counteract those qualities in the executive which are the most necessary ingredients in its composition vigor and expedition and this without anycounterbalancing good in the conduct of war in which the energy of the executive is the bulwark of the national security every thing would be to be apprehended from its plurality,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it must be confessed that these observations apply with principal weight to the first case supposed that is to a plurality of magistrates of equal dignity and authority a scheme the advocates for which are not likely to form a numerous sect but they apply though not with equal yet with considerable weight to the project of a council whose concurrence is made constitutionally necessary to the operations of the ostensible executive an artful cabal in that council would be able to distract and to enervate the whole system of administration if no such cabal should exist the mere diversity of views and opinions would alone be sufficient to tincture the exercise of the executive authority with a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but one of the weightiest objections to a plurality in the executive and which lies as much against the last as the first plan is that it tends to conceal faults and destroy responsibility responsibility is of two kinds to censure and to punishment the first is the more important of the two especially in an elective office man in public trust will much oftener act in such a manner as to render him unworthy of being any longer trusted than in such a manner as to make him obnoxious to legal punishment but the multiplication of the executive adds to the difficulty of detection in either case it often becomes impossible amidst mutual accusations to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure or series of pernicious measures ought really to fall it is shifted from one to another with so much dexterity and under such plausible appearances that the public opinion is left in suspense about the real author the circumstances which may have led to any national miscarriage or misfortune are sometimes so complicated that where there are a number of actors who may have had different degrees and kinds of agency though we may clearly see upon the whole that there has been mismanagement yet it may be impracticable to pronounce to whose account the evil which may have been incurred is truly chargeable `` i was overruled by my council the council were so divided in their opinions that it was impossible to obtain any better resolution on the point '' these and similar pretexts are constantly at hand whether true or false and who is there that will either take the trouble or incur the odium of a strict scrunity into the secret springs of the transaction should there be found a citizen zealous enough to undertake the unpromising task if there happen to be collusion between the parties concerned how easy it is to clothe the circumstances with so much ambiguity as to render it uncertain what was the precise conduct of any of those parties,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the single instance in which the governor of this state is coupled with a council that is in the appointment to offices we have seen the mischiefs of it in the view now under consideration scandalous appointments to important offices have been made some cases indeed have been so flagrant that all parties have agreed in the impropriety of the thing when inquiry has been made the blame has been laid by the governor on the members of the council who on their part have charged it upon his nomination while the people remain altogether at a loss to determine by whose influence their interests have been committed to hands so unqualified and so manifestly improper in tenderness to individuals i forbear to descend to particulars,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is evident from these considerations that the plurality of the executive tends to deprive the people of the two greatest securities they can have for the faithful exercise of any delegated power first the restraints of public opinion which lose their efficacy as well on account of the division of the censure attendant on bad measures among a number as on account of the uncertainty on whom it ought to fall and secondly the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the persons they trust in order either to their removal from office or to their actual punishment in cases which admit of it,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> in england the king is a perpetual magistrate and it is a maxim which has obtained for the sake of the pub lic peace that he is unaccountable for his administration and his person sacred nothing therefore can be wiser in that kingdom than to annex to the king a constitutional council who may be responsible to the nation for the advice they give without this there would be no responsibility whatever in the executive department an idea inadmissible in a free government but even there the king is not bound by the resolutions of his council though they are answerable for the advice they give he is the absolute master of his own conduct in the exercise of his office and may observe or disregard the counsel given to him at his sole discretion,"O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O . , , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but in a republic where every magistrate ought to be personally responsible for his behavior in office the reason which in the british constitution dictates the propriety of a council not only ceases to apply but turns against the institution in the monarchy of great britain it furnishes a substitute for the prohibited responsibility of the chief magistrate which serves in some degree as a hostage to the national justice for his good behavior in the american republic it would serve to destroy or would greatly diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief magistrate himself,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> the idea of a council to the executive which has so generally obtained in the state constitutions has been derived from that maxim of republican jealousy which considers power as safer in the hands of a number of men than of a single man if the maxim should be admitted to be applicable to the case i should contend that the advantage on that side would not counterbalance the numerous disadvantages on the opposite side but i do not think the rule at all applicable to the executive power i clearly concur in opinion in this particular with a writer whom the celebrated junius pronounces to be `` deep solid and ingenious '' that `` the executive power is more easily confined when it is one '' 2 that it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people and in a word that all multiplication of the executive is rather dangerous than friendly to liberty,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

"<bos> a little consideration will satisfy us that the species of security sought for in the multiplication of the executive is nattainable numbers must be so great as to render combination difficult or they are rather a source of danger than of security the united credit and influence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty than the credit and influence of either of them separately when power therefore is placed in the hands of so small a number of men as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise by an artful leader it becomes more liable to abuse and more dangerous when abused than if it be lodged in the hands of one man who from the very circumstance of his being alone will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected and who can not unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others the decemvirs of rome whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded in their usurpation than any one of them would have been no person would think of proposing an executive much more numerous than that body from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the council the extreme of these numbers is not too great for an easy combination and from such a combination america would have more to fear than from the ambition of any single individual a council to a magistrate who is himself responsible for what he does are generally nothing better than a clog upon his good intentions are often the instruments and accomplices of his bad and are almost always a cloak to his faults","O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O .

<bos> i forbear to dwell upon the subject of expense though it be evident that if the council should be numerous enough to answer the principal end aimed at by the institution the salaries of the members who must be drawn from their homes to reside at the seat of government would form an item in the catalogue of public expenditures too serious to be incurred for an object of equivocal utility i will only add that prior to the appearance of the constitution i rarely met with an intelligent man from any of the states who did not admit as the result of experience that the unity of the executive of this state was one of the best of the distinguishing features of our constitution,"O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to the people of the state of new york,O O O O O O O O O :
<bos> a review of the principal objections that have appeared against the proposed court for the trial of impeachments will not improbably eradicate the remains of any unfavorable impressions which may still exist in regard to this matter,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the first of these objections is that the provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body in violation of that important and wellestablished maxim which requires a separation between the different departments of power the true meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of those departments for special purposes preserving them in the main distinct and unconnected this partial intermixture is even in some cases not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the several members of the government against each other an absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative body is admitted by the ablest adepts in political science to be an indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the former and it may perhaps with no less reason be contended that the powers relating to impeachments are as before intimated an essential check in the hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive the division of them between the two branches of the legislature assigning to one the right of accusing to the other the right of judging avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both accusers and judges and guards against the danger of persecution from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of those branches as the concurrence of two thirds of the senate will be requisite to a condemnation the security to innocence from this additional circumstance will be as complete as itself can desire,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O . O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is curious to observe with what vehemence this part of the plan is assailed on the principle here taken notice of by men who profess to admire without exception the constitution of this state while that constitution makes the senate together with the chancellor and judges of the supreme court not only a court of impeachments but the highest judicatory in the state in all causes civil and criminal the proportion in point of numbers of the chancellor and judges to the senators is so inconsiderable that the judiciary authority of new york in the last resort may with truth be said to reside in its senate if the plan of the convention be in this respect chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim which has been so often mentioned and seems to be so little understood how much more culpable must be the constitution of new york 1,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O , O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O , O O .

<bos> a second objection to the senate as a court of impeachments is that it contributes to an undue accumulation of power in that body tending to give to the government a countenance too aristocratic the senate it is observed is to have concurrent authority with the executive in the formation of treaties and in the appointment to offices if say the objectors to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of impeachment it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial influence to an objection so little precise in itself it is not easy to find a very precise answer where is the measure or criterion to which we can appeal for determining what will give the senate too much too little or barely the proper degree of influence will it not be more safe as well as more simple to dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations to examine each power by itself and to decide on general principles where it may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience,"O O O O O O , O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O ? O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> if we take this course it will lead to a more intelligible if not to a more certain result the disposition of the power of making treaties which has obtained in the plan of the convention will then if i mistake not appear to be fully justified by the considerations stated in a former number and by others which will occur under the next head of our inquiries the expediency of the junction of the senate with the executive in the power of appointing to offices will i trust be placed in a light not less satisfactory in the disquisitions under the same head and i flatter myself the observations in my last paper must have gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was not easy if practicable to find a more fit receptacle for the power of determining impeachments than that which has been chosen if this be truly the case the hypothetical dread of the too great weight of the senate ought to be discarded from our reasonings,"O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , , , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , , O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> but this hypothesis such as it is has already been refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office prescribed for the senators it was by them shown as well on the credit of historical examples as from the reason of the thing that the most popular branch of every government partaking of the republican genius by being generally the favorite of the people will be as generally a full match if not an overmatch for every other member of the government,"O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> but independent of this most active and operative principle to secure the equilibrium of the national house of representatives the plan of the convention has provided in its favor several important counterpoises to the additional authorities to be conferred upon the senate the exclusive privilege of originating money bills will belong to the house of representatives the same house will possess the sole right of instituting impeachments is not this a complete counterbalance to that of determining them the same house will be the umpire in all elections of the president which do not unite the suffrages of a majority of the whole number of electors a case which it can not be doubted will sometimes if not frequently happen the constant possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of influence to that body the more it is contemplated the more important will appear this ultimate though contingent power of deciding the competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the union for the first office in it it would not perhaps be rash to predict that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the senate,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O , . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a third objection to the senate as a court of impeachments is drawn from the agency they are to have in the appointments to office it is imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of men in whose official creation they had participated the principle of this objection would condemn a practice which is to be seen in all the state governments if not in all the governments with which we are acquainted i mean that of rendering those who hold offices during pleasure dependent on the pleasure of those who appoint them with equal plausibility might it be alleged in this case that the favoritism of the latter would always be an asylum for the misbehavior of the former but that practice in contradiction to this principle proceeds upon the presumption that the responsibility of those who appoint for the fitness and competency of the persons on whom they bestow their choice and the interest they will have in the respectable and prosperous administration of affairs will inspire a sufficient disposition to dismiss from a share in it all such who by their conduct shall have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence reposed in them though facts may not always correspond with this presumption yet if it be in the main just it must destroy the supposition that the senate who will merely sanction the choice of the executive should feel a bias towards the objects of that choice strong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so extraordinary as to have induced the representatives of the nation to become its accusers,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> if any further arguments were necessary to evince the improbability of such a bias it might be found in the nature of the agency of the senate in the business of appointments,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it will be the office of the president to nominate and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint there will of course be no exertion of choice on the part of the senate they may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make another but they can not themselves choose they can only ratify or reject the choice of the president they might even entertain a preference to some other person at the very moment they were assenting to the one proposed because there might be no positive ground of opposition to him and they could not be sure if they withheld their assent that the subsequent nomination would fall upon their own favorite or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious than the one rejected thus it could hardly happen that the majority of the senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire and the proofs of the want of it destroy,"O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O . O , O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a fourth objection to the senate in the capacity of a court of impeachments is derived from its union with the executive in the power of making treaties this it has been said would constitute the senators their own judges in every case of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that trust after having combined with the executive in betraying the interests of the nation in a ruinous treaty what prospect it is asked would there be of their being made to suffer the punishment they would deserve when they were themselves to decide upon the accusation brought against them for the treachery of which they have been guilty,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> this objection has been circulated with more earnestness and with greater show of reason than any other which has appeared against this part of the plan and yet i am deceived if it does not rest upon an erroneous foundation,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O .
<bos> the security essentially intended by the constitution against corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties is to be sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to make them the joint agency of the chief magistrate of the union and of two thirds of the members of a body selected by the collective wisdom of the legislatures of the several states is designed to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national councils in this particular the convention might with propriety have meditated the punishment of the executive for a deviation from the instructions of the senate or a want of integrity in the conduct of the negotiations committed to him they might also have had in view the punishment of a few leading individuals in the senate who should have prostituted their influence in that body as the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption but they could not with more or with equal propriety have contemplated the impeachment and punishment of two thirds of the senate consenting to an improper treaty than of a majority of that or of the other branch of the national legislature consenting to a pernicious or unconstitutional law a principle which i believe has never been admitted into any government how in fact could a majority in the house of representatives impeach themselves not better it is evident than two thirds of the senate might try themselves and yet what reason is there that a majority of the house of representatives sacrificing the interests of the society by an unjust and tyrannical act of legislation should escape with impunity more than two thirds of the senate sacrificing the same interests in an injurious treaty with a foreign power the truth is that in all such cases it is essential to the freedom and to the necessary independence of the deliberations of the body that the members of it should be exempt from punishment for acts done in a collective capacity and the security to the society must depend on the care which is taken to confide the trust to proper hands to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity and to make it as difficult as possible for them to combine in any interest opposite to that of the public good,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> so far as might concern the misbehavior of the executive in perverting the instructions or contravening the views of the senate we need not be apprehensive of the want of a disposition in that body to punish the abuse of their confidence or to vindicate their own authority we may thus far count upon their pride if not upon their virtue and so far even as might concern the corruption of leading members by whose arts and influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures odious to the community if the proofs of that corruption should be satisfactory the usual propensity of human nature will warrant us in concluding that there would be commonly no defect of inclination in the body to divert the public resentment from themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of their mismanagement and disgrace,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> to the people of the state of new york,O O O O O O O O O :
<bos> we proceed now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .
<bos> in unfolding the defects of the existing confederation the utility and necessity of a federal judicature have been clearly pointed out it is the less necessary to recapitulate the considerations there urged as the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed the only questions which have been raised being relative to the manner of constituting it and to its extent to these points therefore our observations shall be confined,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O . O O , , O O O O ."
<bos> the manner of constituting it seems to embrace these several objects 1st the mode of appointing the judges 2d the tenure by which they are to hold their places 3d the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other,"O O O O O O O O O O O : . O O O O O . . O O O O O O O O O . . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ."
<bos> first as to the mode of appointing the judges this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in general and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition,"O . O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> second as to the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places this chiefly concerns their duration in office the provisions for their support the precautions for their responsibility,O . O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O ; O O O O .
<bos> according to the plan of the convention all judges who may be appointed by the united states are to hold their offices during good behavior which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions and among the rest to that of this state its propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan is no light symptom of the rage for objection which disorders their imaginations and judgments the standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government in a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body and it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government to secure a steady upright and impartial administration of the laws,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , , O O O O O ."
<bos> whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive that in a government in which they are separated from each other the judiciary from the nature of its functions will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them the executive not only dispenses the honors but holds the sword of the community the legislature not only commands the purse but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated the judiciary on the contrary has no influence over either the sword or the purse no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society and can take no active resolution whatever it may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely judgment and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments,"O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> this simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences it proves incontestably that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power1 that it can never attack with success either of the other two and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks it equally proves that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter i mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the executive for i agree that `` there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers `` 2 and it proves in the last place that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation that as from the natural feebleness of the judiciary it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered awed or influenced by its co-ordinate branches and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution and in a great measure as the citadel of the public justice and the public security,"O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ; O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution by a limited constitution i understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority such for instance as that it shall pass no bills of attainder no ex-post-facto laws and the like limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void without this all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void because contrary to the constitution has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power it is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void as this doctrine is of great importance in all the american constitutions a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests can not be unacceptable,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> there is no position which depends on clearer principles than that every act of a delegated authority contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised is void no legislative act therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid to deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal that the servant is above his master that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorize but what they forbid,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O . O O , , O O O , O O . O O , O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> if it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments it may be answered that this can not be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the constitution it is not otherwise to be supposed that the constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents it is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order among other things to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority the interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law it therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred or in other words the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute the intention of the people to the intention of their agents,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O , O O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power it only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both and that where the will of the legislature declared in its statutes stands in opposition to that of the people declared in the constitution the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former they ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws rather than by those which are not fundamental,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two contradictory laws is exemplified in a familiar instance it not uncommonly happens that there are two statutes existing at one time clashing in whole or in part with each other and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression in such a case it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation so far as they can by any fair construction be reconciled to each other reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done where this is impracticable it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one in exclusion of the other the rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first but this is a mere rule of construction not derived from any positive law but from the nature and reason of the thing it is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision but adopted by themselves as consonant to truth and propriety for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law they thought it reasonable that between the interfering acts of an equal authority that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference,"O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> but in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority of an original and derivative power the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed they teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority and that accordingly whenever a particular statute contravenes the constitution it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it can be of no weight to say that the courts on the pretense of a repugnancy may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature this might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute the courts must declare the sense of the law and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body the observation if it prove any thing would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> if then the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty,"O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
"<bos> this independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors which the arts of designing men or the influence of particular conjunctures sometimes disseminate among the people themselves and which though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection have a tendency in the meantime to occasion dangerous innovations in the government and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community though i trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies,3 in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness yet it is not to be inferred from this principle that the representatives of the people whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents incompatible with the provisions in the existing constitution would on that account be justifiable in a violation of those provisions or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body until the people have by some solemn and authoritative act annulled or changed the established form it is binding upon themselves collectively as well as individually and no presumption or even knowledge of their sentiments can warrant their representatives in a departure from it prior to such an act but it is easy to see that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the constitution where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community","O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution only that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humors in the society these sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens by unjust and partial laws here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and confining the operation of such laws it not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them who perceiving that obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts are in a manner compelled by the very motives of the injustice they meditate to qualify their attempts this is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments than but few may be aware of the benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more states than one and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested considerate men of every description ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice by which he may be a gainer to-day and every man must now feel that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence and to introduce in its stead universal distrust and distress,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> that inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the constitution and of individuals which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission periodical appointments however regulated or by whomsoever made would in some way or other be fatal to their necessary independence if the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legislature there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it if to both there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either if to the people or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the constitution and the laws,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there is yet a further and a weightier reason for the permanency of the judicial offices which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require it has been frequently remarked with great propriety that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government to avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them hence it is that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges and making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge these considerations apprise us that the government can have no great option between fit character and that a temporary duration in office which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able and less well qualified to conduct it with utility and dignity in the present circumstances of this country and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear but it must be confessed that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> upon the whole there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behavior as the tenure of their judicial offices in point of duration and that so far from being blamable on this account their plan would have been inexcusably defective if it had wanted this important feature of good government the experience of great britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the tendency of the principle of legislation for states or communities in their political capacities as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it is equally attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind of which we have any account in exact proportion to its prevalence in those systems the confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination i shall content myself with barely observing here that of all the confederacies of antiquity which history has handed down to us the lycian and achaean leagues as far as there remain vestiges of them appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken principle and were accordingly those which have best deserved and have most liberally received the applauding suffrages of political writers,"O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this exceptionable principle may as truly as emphatically be styled the parent of anarchy it has been seen that delinquencies in the members of the union are its natural and necessary offspring and that whenever they happen the only constitutional remedy is force and the immediate effect of the use of it civil war,"O O O O , O O O , O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O ."
<bos> it remains to inquire how far so odious an engine of government in its application to us would even be capable of answering its end if there should not be a large army constantly at the disposal of the national government it would either not be able to employ force at all or when this could be done it would amount to a war between parts of the confederacy concerning the infractions of a league in which the strongest combination would be most likely to prevail whether it consisted of those who supported or of those who resisted the general authority it would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member and if there were more than one who had neglected their duty similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common defense independent of this motive of sympathy if a large and influential state should happen to be the aggressing member it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbors to win over some of them as associates to its cause specious arguments of danger to the common liberty could easily be contrived plausible excuses for the deficiencies of the party could without difficulty be invented to alarm the apprehensions inflame the passions and conciliate the good-will even of those states which were not chargeable with any violation or omission of duty this would be the more likely to take place as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent states if associates could not be found at home recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a confederacy from the firm union of which they had so much to fear when the sword is once drawn the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation the suggestions of wounded pride the instigations of irritated resentment would be apt to carry the states against which the arms of the union were exerted to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of submission the first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> this may be considered as the violent death of the confederacy its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form it is not probable considering the genius of this country that the complying states would often be inclined to support the authority of the union by engaging in a war against the non-complying states they would always be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members by an imitation of their example and the guilt of all would thus become the security of all our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full light there would in fact be an insuperable difficulty in ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed in the article of pecuniary contribution which would be the most usual source of delinquency it would often be impossible to decide whether it had proceeded from disinclination or inability the pretense of the latter would always be at hand and the case must be very flagrant in which its fallacy could be detected with sufficient certainty to justify the harsh expedient of compulsion it is easy to see that this problem alone as often as it should occur would open a wide field for the exercise of factious views of partiality and of oppression in the majority that happened to prevail in the national council,"O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it seems to require no pains to prove that the states ought not to prefer a national constitution which could only be kept in motion by the instrumentality of a large army continually on foot to execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government and yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of extending its operations to individuals such a scheme if practicable at all would instantly degenerate into a military despotism but it will be found in every light impracticable the resources of the union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger states within the limits of their duty nor would the means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these states singly at the present juncture and looks forward to what they will become even at the distance of half a century will at once dismiss as idle and visionary any scheme which aims at regulating their movements by laws to operate upon them in their collective capacities and to be executed by a coercion applicable to them in the same capacities a project of this kind is little less romantic than the monster-taming spirit which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> even in those confederacies which have been composed of members smaller than many of our counties the principle of legislation for sovereign states supported by military coercion has never been found effectual it has rarely been attempted to be employed but against the weaker members and in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and disobedient have been the signals of bloody wars in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be clearly this that if it be possible at any rate to construct a federal government capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the general tranquillity it must be founded as to the objects committed to its care upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the opponents of the proposed constitution it must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens it must stand in need of no intermediate legislations but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions the majesty of the national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts of justice the government of the union like that of each state must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals and to attract to its support those passions which have the strongest influence upon the human heart it must in short possess all the means and have aright to resort to all the methods of executing the powers with which it is intrusted that are possessed and exercised by the government of the particular states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to this reasoning it may perhaps be objected that if any state should be disaffected to the authority of the union it could at any time obstruct the execution of its laws and bring the matter to the same issue of force with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is reproached,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the pausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to the essential difference between a mere non-compliance and a direct and active resistance if the interposition of the state legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the union they have only not to act or to act evasively and the measure is defeated this neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions so as not to appear and of course not to excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the constitution the state leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it on the ground of some temporary convenience exemption or advantage,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O ."
<bos> but if the execution of the laws of the national government should not require the intervention of the state legislatures if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power no omissions nor evasions would answer the end they would be obliged to act and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights an experiment of this nature would always be hazardous in the face of a constitution in any degree competent to its own defense and of a people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority the success of it would require not merely a factious majority in the legislature but the concurrence of the courts of justice and of the body of the people if the judges were not embarked in a conspiracy with the legislature they would pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the supreme law of the land unconstitutional and void if the people were not tainted with the spirit of their state representatives they as the natural guardians of the constitution would throw their weight into the national scale and give it a decided preponderancy in the contest attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness because they could seldom be made without danger to the authors unless in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the federal authority,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if opposition to the national government should arise from the disorderly conduct of refractory or seditious individuals it could be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the same evil under the state governments the magistracy being equally the ministers of the law of the land from whatever source it might emanate would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness as to those partial commotions and insurrections which sometimes disquiet society from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction or from sudden or occasional illhumors that do not infect the great body of the community the general government could command more extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind than would be in the power of any single member and as to those mortal feuds which in certain conjunctures spread a conflagration through a whole nation or through a very large proportion of it proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the government or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxysm they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation when they happen they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments of empire no form of government can always either avoid or control them it is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for human foresight or precaution and it would be idle to object to a government because it could not perform impossibilities,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the more candid opposers of the provision respecting elections contained in the plan of the convention when pressed in argument will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision with this qualification however that it ought to have been accompanied with a declaration that all elections should be had in the counties where the electors resided this say they was a necessary precaution against an abuse of the power a declaration of this nature would certainly have been harmless so far as it would have had the effect of quieting apprehensions it might not have been undesirable but it would in fact have afforded little or no additional security against the danger apprehended and the want of it will never be considered by an impartial and judicious examiner as a serious still less as an insuperable objection to the plan the different views taken of the subject in the two preceding papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate and discerning men that if the public liberty should ever be the victim of the ambition of the national rulers the power under examination at least will be guiltless of the sacrifice,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O , , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several state constitutions they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect a review of their situation in this particular would tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this matter but as that view would lead into long and tedious details i shall content myself with the single example of the state in which i write the constitution of new york makes no other provision for locality of elections than that the members of the assembly shall be elected in the counties those of the senate in the great districts into which the state is or may be divided these at present are four in number and comprehend each from two to six counties it may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of new york to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of new york by confining elections to particular places than for the legislature of the united states to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the union by the like expedient suppose for instance the city of albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the senate and assembly for that county and district can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of albany saratoga cambridge etc. or in any part of the county of montgomery would take the trouble to come to the city of albany to give their votes for members of the assembly or senate sooner than they would repair to the city of new york to participate in the choice of the members of the federal house of representatives the alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws which afford every facility to it furnishes a ready answer to this question and abstracted from any experience on the subject we can be at no loss to determine that when the place of election is at an inconvenient distance from the elector the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles hence it must appear that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will in substance apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this state and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one and to condemn the other a similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other states,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if it should be said that defects in the state constitutions furnish no apology for those which are to be found in the plan proposed i answer that as the former have never been thought chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty where the imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be applicable to them also the presumption is that they are rather the cavilling refinements of a predetermined opposition than the well-founded inferences of a candid research after truth to those who are disposed to consider as innocent omissions in the state constitutions what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the plan of the convention nothing can be said or at most they can only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the representatives of the people in a single state should be more impregnable to the lust of power or other sinister motives than the representatives of the people of the united states if they can not do this they ought at least to prove to us that it is easier to subvert the liberties of three millions of people with the advantage of local governments to head their opposition than of two hundred thousand people who are destitute of that advantage and in relation to the point immediately under consideration they ought to convince us that it is less probable that a predominant faction in a single state should in order to maintain its superiority incline to a preference of a particular class of electors than that a similar spirit should take possession of the representatives of thirteen states spread over a vast region and in several respects distinguishable from each other by a diversity of local circumstances prejudices and interests,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> hitherto my observations have only aimed at a vindication of the provision in question on the ground of theoretic propriety on that of the danger of placing the power elsewhere and on that of the safety of placing it in the manner proposed but there remains to be mentioned a positive advantage which will result from this disposition and which could not as well have been obtained from any other i allude to the circumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the federal house of representatives it is more than possible that this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great importance to the public welfare both as a security against the perpetuation of the same spirit in the body and as a cure for the diseases of faction if each state may choose its own time of election it is possible there may be at least as many different periods as there are months in the year the times of election in the several states as they are now established for local purposes vary between extremes as wide as march and november the consequence of this diversity would be that there could never happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time if an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it that spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members as they come forward in succession the mass would be likely to remain nearly the same assimilating constantly to itself its gradual accretions there is a contagion in example which few men have sufficient force of mind to resist i am inclined to think that treble the duration in office with the condition of a total dissolution of the body at the same time might be less formidable to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and successive alterations,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> uniformity in the time of elections seems not less requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the senate and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a stated period in each year,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it may be asked why then could not a time have been fixed in the constitution as the most zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention in this state are in general not less zealous admirers of the constitution of the state the question may be retorted and it may be asked why was not a time for the like purpose fixed in the constitution of this state no better answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely be entrusted to legislative discretion and that if a time had been appointed it might upon experiment have been found less convenient than some other time the same answer may be given to the question put on the other side and it may be added that the supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative it would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to establish as a fundamental point what would deprive several states of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government at the same epochs,"O O O O , , , O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> the remaining powers which the plan of the convention allots to the senate in a distinct capacity are comprised in their participation with the executive in the appointment to offices and in their judicial character as a court for the trial of impeachments as in the business of appointments the executive will be the principal agent the provisions relating to it will most properly be discussed in the examination of that department we will therefore conclude this head with a view of the judicial character of the senate,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a well-constituted court for the trial of impeachments is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective the subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust they are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself the prosecution of them for this reason will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused in many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions and will enlist all their animosities partialities influence and interest on one side or on the other and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the delicacy and magnitude of a trust which so deeply concerns the political reputation and existence of every man engaged in the administration of public affairs speak for themselves the difficulty of placing it rightly in a government resting entirely on the basis of periodical elections will as readily be perceived when it is considered that the most conspicuous characters in it will from that circumstance be too often the leaders or the tools of the most cunning or the most numerous faction and on this account can hardly be expected to possess the requisite neutrality towards those whose conduct may be the subject of scrutiny,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the convention it appears thought the senate the most fit depositary of this important trust those who can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing will be least hasty in condemning that opinion and will be most inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be supposed to have produced it,"O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> what it may be asked is the true spirit of the institution itself is it not designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men if this be the design of it who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves it is not disputed that the power of originating the inquiry or in other words of preferring the impeachment ought to be lodged in the hands of one branch of the legislative body will not the reasons which indicate the propriety of this arrangement strongly plead for an admission of the other branch of that body to a share of the inquiry the model from which the idea of this institution has been borrowed pointed out that course to the convention in great britain it is the province of the house of commons to prefer the impeachment and of the house of lords to decide upon it several of the state constitutions have followed the example as well the latter as the former seem to have regarded the practice of impeachments as a bridle in the hands of the legislative body upon the executive servants of the government is not this the true light in which it ought to be regarded,"O , O O O , O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O .

<bos> where else than in the senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified or sufficiently independent what other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused and the representatives of the people his accusers,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O ?"
<bos> could the supreme court have been relied upon as answering this description it is much to be doubted whether the members of that tribunal would at all times be endowed with so eminent a portion of fortitude as would be called for in the execution of so difficult a task and it is still more to be doubted whether they would possess the degree of credit and authority which might on certain occasions be indispensable towards reconciling the people to a decision that should happen to clash with an accusation brought by their immediate representatives a deficiency in the first would be fatal to the accused in the last dangerous to the public tranquillity the hazard in both these respects could only be avoided if at all by rendering that tribunal more numerous than would consist with a reasonable attention to economy the necessity of a numerous court for the trial of impeachments is equally dictated by the nature of the proceeding this can never be tied down by such strict rules either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors or in the construction of it by the judges as in common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security there will be no jury to stand between the judges who are to pronounce the sentence of the law and the party who is to receive or suffer it the awful discretion which a court of impeachments must necessarily have to doom to honor or to infamy the most confidential and the most distinguished characters of the community forbids the commitment of the trust to a small number of persons,"O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> these considerations seem alone sufficient to authorize a conclusion that the supreme court would have been an improper substitute for the senate as a court of impeachments there remains a further consideration which will not a little strengthen this conclusion it is this the punishment which may be the consequence of conviction upon impeachment is not to terminate the chastisement of the offender after having been sentenced to a prepetual ostracism from the esteem and confidence and honors and emoluments of his country he will still be liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law would it be proper that the persons who had disposed of his fame and his most valuable rights as a citizen in one trial should in another trial for the same offense be also the disposers of his life and his fortune would there not be the greatest reason to apprehend that error in the first sentence would be the parent of error in the second sentence that the strong bias of one decision would be apt to overrule the influence of any new lights which might be brought to vary the complexion of another decision those who know anything of human nature will not hesitate to answer these questions in the affirmative and will be at no loss to perceive that by making the same persons judges in both cases those who might happen to be the objects of prosecution would in a great measure be deprived of the double security intended them by a double trial the loss of life and estate would often be virtually included in a sentence which in its terms imported nothing more than dismission from a present and disqualification for a future office it may be said that the intervention of a jury in the second instance would obviate the danger but juries are frequently influenced by the opinions of judges they are sometimes induced to find special verdicts which refer the main question to the decision of the court who would be willing to stake his life and his estate upon the verdict of a jury acting under the auspices of judges who had predetermined his guilt,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> would it have been an improvement of the plan to have united the supreme court with the senate in the formation of the court of impeachments this union would certainly have been attended with several advantages but would they not have been overbalanced by the signal disadvantage already stated arising from the agency of the same judges in the double prosecution to which the offender would be liable to a certain extent the benefits of that union will be obtained from making the chief justice of the supreme court the president of the court of impeachments as is proposed to be done in the plan of the convention while the inconveniences of an entire incorporation of the former into the latter will be substantially avoided this was perhaps the prudent mean i forbear to remark upon the additional pretext for clamor against the judiciary which so considerable an augmentation of its authority would have afforded,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ?

<bos> would it have been desirable to have composed the court for the trial of impeachments of persons wholly distinct from the other departments of the government there are weighty arguments as well against as in favor of such a plan to some minds it will not appear a trivial objection that it could tend to increase the complexity of the political machine and to add a new spring to the government the utility of which would at best be questionable but an objection which will not be thought by any unworthy of attention is this a court formed upon such a plan would either be attended with a heavy expense or might in practice be subject to a variety of casualties and inconveniences it must either consist of permanent officers stationary at the seat of government and of course entitled to fixed and regular stipends or of certain officers of the state governments to be called upon whenever an impeachment was actually depending it will not be easy to imagine any third mode materially different which could rationally be proposed as the court for reasons already given ought to be numerous the first scheme will be reprobated by every man who can compare the extent of the public wants with the means of supplying them the second will be espoused with caution by those who will seriously consider the difficulty of collecting men dispersed over the whole union the injury to the innocent from the procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought against them the advantage to the guilty from the opportunities which delay would afford to intrigue and corruption and in some cases the detriment to the state from the prolonged inaction of men whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the house of representatives though this latter supposition may seem harsh and might not be likely often to be verified yet it ought not to be forgotten that the demon of faction will at certain seasons extend his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> but though one or the other of the substitutes which have been examined or some other that might be devised should be thought preferable to the plan in this respect reported by the convention it will not follow that the constitution ought for this reason to be rejected if mankind were to resolve to agree in no institution of government until every part of it had been adjusted to the most exact standard of perfection society would soon become a general scene of anarchy and the world a desert where is the standard of perfection to be found who will undertake to unite the discordant opinions of a whole commuity in the same judgment of it and to prevail upon one conceited projector to renounce his infallible criterion for the fallible criterion of his more conceited neighbor to answer the purpose of the adversaries of the constitution they ought to prove not merely that particular provisions in it are not the best which might have been imagined but that the plan upon the whole is bad and pernicious,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the president is to have power `` by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur '',"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O . O"
<bos> though this provision has been assailed on different grounds with no small degree of vehemence i scruple not to declare my firm persuasion that it is one of the best digested and most unexceptionable parts of the plan one ground of objection is the trite topic of the intermixture of powers some contending that the president ought alone to possess the power of making treaties others that it ought to have been exclusively deposited in the senate another source of objection is derived from the small number of persons by whom a treaty may be made of those who espouse this objection a part are of opinion that the house of representatives ought to have been associated in the business while another part seem to think that nothing more was necessary than to have substituted two thirds of all the members of the senate to two thirds of the members present as i flatter myself the observations made in a preceding number upon this part of the plan must have sufficed to place it to a discerning eye in a very favorable light i shall here content myself with offering only some supplementary remarks principally with a view to the objections which have been just stated,"O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> with regard to the intermixture of powers i shall rely upon the explanations already given in other places of the true sense of the rule upon which that objection is founded and shall take it for granted as an inference from them that the union of the executive with the senate in the article of treaties is no infringement of that rule i venture to add that the particular nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar propriety in that union though several writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of executive authorities yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition for if we attend carefully to its operation it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them the essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws or in other words to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society while the execution of the laws and the employment of the common strength either for this purpose or for the common defense seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate the power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other it relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws nor to the enaction of new ones and still less to an exertion of the common strength its objects are contracts with foreign nations which have the force of law but derive it from the obligations of good faith they are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject but agreements between sovereign and sovereign the power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department and to belong properly neither to the legislative nor to the executive the qualities elsewhere detailed as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations point out the executive as the most fit agent in those transactions while the vast importance of the trust and the operation of treaties as laws plead strongly for the participation of the whole or a portion of the legislative body in the office of making them,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> however proper or safe it may be in governments where the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch to commit to him the entire power of making treaties it would be utterly unsafe and improper to intrust that power to an elective magistrate of four years duration it has been remarked upon another occasion and the remark is unquestionably just that an hereditary monarch though often the oppressor of his people has personally too much stake in the government to be in any material danger of being corrupted by foreign powers but a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate possessed of a moderate or slender fortune and looking forward to a period not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to the station from which he was taken might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest which it would require superlative virtue to withstand an avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth an ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement by the aid of a foreign power the price of his treachery to his constituents the history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a president of the united states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ' .

<bos> to have intrusted the power of making treaties to the senate alone would have been to relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency of the president in the conduct of foreign negotiations it is true that the senate would in that case have the option of employing him in this capacity but they would also have the option of letting it alone and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather than the former besides this the ministerial servant of the senate could not be expected to enjoy the confidence and respect of foreign powers in the same degree with the constitutional representatives of the nation and of course would not be able to act with an equal degree of weight or efficacy while the union would from this cause lose a considerable advantage in the management of its external concerns the people would lose the additional security which would result from the co-operation of the executive though it would be imprudent to confide in him solely so important a trust yet it can not be doubted that his participation would materially add to the safety of the society it must indeed be clear to a demonstration that the joint possession of the power in question by the president and senate would afford a greater prospect of security than the separate possession of it by either of them and whoever has maturely weighed the circumstances which must concur in the appointment of a president will be satisfied that the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of such characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of treaties peculiarly desirable as well on the score of wisdom as on that of integrity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the remarks made in a former number which have been alluded to in another part of this paper will apply with conclusive force against the admission of the house of representatives to a share in the formation of treaties the fluctuating and taking its future increase into the account the multitudinous composition of that body forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of such a trust accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign politics a steady and systematic adherence to the same views a nice and uniform sensibility to national character decision secrecy and despatch are incompatible with the genius of a body so variable and so numerous the very complication of the business by introducing a necessity of the concurrence of so many different bodies would of itself afford a solid objection the greater frequency of the calls upon the house of representatives and the greater length of time which it would often be necessary to keep them together when convened to obtain their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty would be a source of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to condemn the project,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the only objection which remains to be canvassed is that which would substitute the proportion of two thirds of all the members composing the senatorial body to that of two thirds of the members present it has been shown under the second head of our inquiries that all provisions which require more than the majority of any body to its resolutions have a direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government and an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the minority this consideration seems sufficient to determine our opinion that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to secure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public councils or with a reasonable regard to the major sense of the community if two thirds of the whole number of members had been required it would in many cases from the non-attendance of a part amount in practice to a necessity of unanimity and the history of every political establishment in which this principle has prevailed is a history of impotence perplexity and disorder proofs of this position might be adduced from the examples of the roman tribuneship the polish diet and the states-general of the netherlands did not an example at home render foreign precedents unnecessary,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to require a fixed proportion of the whole body would not in all probability contribute to the advantages of a numerous agency better then merely to require a proportion of the attending members the former by making a determinate number at all times requisite to a resolution diminishes the motives to punctual attendance the latter by making the capacity of the body to depend on a proportion which may be varied by the absence or presence of a single member has the contrary effect and as by promoting punctuality it tends to keep the body complete there is great likelihood that its resolutions would generally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the other while there would be much fewer occasions of delay it ought not to be forgotten that under the existing confederation two members may and usually do represent a state whence it happens that congress who now are solely invested with all the powers of the union rarely consist of a greater number of persons than would compose the intended senate if we add to this that as the members vote by states and that where there is only a single member present from a state his vote is lost it will justify a supposition that the active voices in the senate where the members are to vote individually would rarely fall short in number of the active voices in the existing congress when in addition to these considerations we take into view the co-operation of the president we shall not hesitate to infer that the people of america would have greater security against an improper use of the power of making treaties under the new constitution than they now enjoy under the confederation and when we proceed still one step further and look forward to the probable augmentation of the senate by the erection of new states we shall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that power will be intrusted but we shall probably be led to conclude that a body more numerous than the senate would be likely to become would be very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to judge with accuracy of the proper extent of the federal judicature it will be necessary to consider in the first place what are its proper objects,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O , O O O O ."
<bos> it seems scarcely to admit of controversy that the judicary authority of the union ought to extend to these several descriptions of cases 1st to all those which arise out of the laws of the united states passed in pursuance of their just and constitutional powers of legislation 2d to all those which concern the execution of the provisions expressly contained in the articles of union 3d to all those in which the united states are a party 4th to all those which involve the peace of the confederacy whether they relate to the intercourse between the united states and foreign nations or to that between the states themselves 5th to all those which originate on the high seas and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction and lastly to all those in which the state tribunals can not be supposed to be impartial and unbiased,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the first point depends upon this obvious consideration that there ought always to be a constitutional method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions what for instance would avail restrictions on the authority of the state legislatures without some constitutional mode of enforcing the observance of them the states by the plan of the convention are prohibited from doing a variety of things some of which are incompatible with the interests of the union and others with the principles of good government the imposition of duties on imported articles and the emission of paper money are specimens of each kind no man of sense will believe that such prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded without some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them this power must either be a direct negative on the state laws or an authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in manifest contravention of the articles of union there is no third course that i can imagine the latter appears to have been thought by the convention preferable to the former and i presume will be most agreeable to the states,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ? O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as to the second point it is impossible by any argument or comment to make it clearer than it is in itself if there are such things as political axioms the propriety of the judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative may be ranked among the number the mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws decides the question thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes arising upon the same laws is a hydra in government from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed,"O O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> still less need be said in regard to the third point controversies between the nation and its members or citizens can only be properly referred to the national tribunals any other plan would be contrary to reason to precedent and to decorum,"O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O , O O ."
<bos> the fourth point rests on this plain proposition that the peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal of a part the union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members and the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with the faculty of preventing it as the denial or perversion of justice by the sentences of courts as well as in any other manner is with reason classed among the just causes of war it will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned this is not less essential to the preservation of the public faith than to the security of the public tranquillity a distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely on the footing of the municipal law the former kind may be supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction the latter for that of the states but it is at least problematical whether an unjust sentence against a foreigner where the subject of controversy was wholly relative to the lex loci would not if unredressed be an aggression upon his sovereign as well as one which violated the stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations and a still greater objection to the distinction would result from the immense difficulty if not impossibility of a practical discrimination between the cases of one complexion and those of the other so great a proportion of the cases in which foreigners are parties involve national questions that it is by far most safe and most expedient to refer all those in which they are concerned to the national tribunals,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the power of determining causes between two states between one state and the citizens of another and between the citizens of different states is perhaps not less essential to the peace of the union than that which has been just examined history gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars which distracted and desolated germany prior to the institution of the imperial chamber by maximilian towards the close of the fifteenth century and informs us at the same time of the vast influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and establishing the tranquillity of the empire this was a court invested with authority to decide finally all differences among the members of the germanic body,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a method of terminating territorial disputes between the states under the authority of the federal head was not unattended to even in the imperfect system by which they have been hitherto held together but there are many other sources besides interfering claims of boundary from which bickerings and animosities may spring up among the members of the union to some of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past experience it will readily be conjectured that i allude to the fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the states and though the proposed constitution establishes particular guards against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore made their appearance yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the spirit which produced them will assume new shapes that could not be foreseen nor specifically provided against whatever practices may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the states are proper objects of federal superintendence and control,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may be esteemed the basis of the union that `` the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states '' and if it be a just principle that every government ought to possess the means of executing its own provisions by its own authority it will follow that in order to the inviolable maintenance of that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens of the union will be entitled the national judiciary ought to preside in all cases in which one state or its citizens are opposed to another state or its citizens to secure the full effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and subterfuge it is necessary that its construction should be committed to that tribunal which having no local attachments will be likely to be impartial between the different states and their citizens and which owing its official existence to the union will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is founded,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the fifth point will demand little animadversion the most bigoted idolizers of state authority have not thus far shown a disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of maritime causes these so generally depend on the laws of nations and so commonly affect the rights of foreigners that they fall within the considerations which are relative to the public peace the most important part of them are by the present confederation submitted to federal jurisdiction,"O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O , O O O ."
<bos> the reasonableness of the agency of the national courts in cases in which the state tribunals can not be supposed to be impartial speaks for itself no man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias this principle has no inconsiderable weight in designating the federal courts as the proper tribunals for the determination of controversies between different states and their citizens and it ought to have the same operation in regard to some cases between citizens of the same state claims to land under grants of different states founded upon adverse pretensions of boundary are of this description the courts of neither of the granting states could be expected to be unbiased the laws may have even prejudged the question and tied the courts down to decisions in favor of the grants of the state to which they belonged and even where this had not been done it would be natural that the judges as men should feel a strong predilection to the claims of their own government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> having thus laid down and discussed the principles which ought to regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary we will proceed to test by these principles the particular powers of which according to the plan of the convention it is to be composed it is to comprehend `` all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority to all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to which the united states shall be a party to controversies between two or more states between a state and citizens of another state between citizens of different states between citizens of the same state claiming lands and grants of different states and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens and subjects '' this constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the union let us now review it in detail it is then to extend,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> first to all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution and the laws of the united states this corresponds with the two first classes of causes which have been enumerated as proper for the jurisdiction of the united states it has been asked what is meant by `` cases arising under the constitution '' in contradiction from those `` arising under the laws of the united states '' the difference has been already explained all the restrictions upon the authority of the state legislatures furnish examples of it they are not for instance to emit paper money but the interdiction results from the constitution and will have no connection with any law of the united states should paper money notwithstanding be emited the controversies concerning it would be cases arising under the constitution and not the laws of the united states in the ordinary signification of the terms this may serve as a sample of the whole,"O .

<bos> it has also been asked what need of the word `` equity what equitable causes can grow out of the constitution and laws of the united states there is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals which may not involve those ingredients of fraud accident trust or hardship which would render the matter an object of equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction as the distinction is known and established in several of the states it is the peculiar province for instance of a court of equity to relieve against what are called hard bargains these are contracts in which though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law yet there may have been some undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or misfortunes of one of the parties which a court of equity would not tolerate in such cases where foreigners were concerned on either side it would be impossible for the federal judicatories to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal jurisdiction agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants of different states may afford another example of the necessity of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts this reasoning may not be so palpable in those states where the formal and technical distinction between law and equity is not maintained as in this state where it is exemplified by every day 's practice,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> from this review of the particular powers of the federal judiciary as marked out in the constitution it appears that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to have governed the structure of that department and which were necessary to the perfection of the system if some partial inconviences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make such exceptions and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences the possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed by a wellinformed mind as a solid objection to a general principle which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain general advantages,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority is an adequate provision for its support it is evident that without proper attention to this article the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and nugatory the legislature with a discretionary power over the salary and emoluments of the chief magistrate could render him as obsequious to their will as they might think proper to make him they might in most cases either reduce him by famine or tempt him by largesses to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations these expressions taken in all the latitude of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended there are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils and in the main it will be found that a power over a man 's support is a power over his will if it were necessary to confirm so plain a truth by facts examples would not be wanting even in this country of the intimidation or seduction of the executive by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniary arrangements of the legislative body,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> it is not easy therefore to commend too highly the judicious attention which has been paid to this subject in the proposed constitution it is there provided that `` the president of the united states shall at stated times receive for his services a compensation which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the united states or any of them '' it is impossible to imagine any provision which would have been more eligible than this the legislature on the appointment of a president is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected this done they will have no power to alter it either by increase or diminution till a new period of service by a new election commences they can neither weaken his fortitude by operating on his necessities nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to his avarice neither the union nor any of its members will be at liberty to give nor will he be at liberty to receive any other emolument than that which may have been determined by the first act he can of course have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the constitution,"O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the last of the requisites to energy which have been enumerated are competent powers let us proceed to consider those which are proposed to be vested in the president of the united states,"O O O O O O O , O O O , O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the first thing that offers itself to our observation is the qualified negative of the president upon the acts or resolutions of the two houses of the legislature or in other words his power of returning all bills with objections to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws unless they should afterwards be ratified by two thirds of each of the component members of the legislative body,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights and to absorb the powers of the other departments has been already suggested and repeated the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each has also been remarked upon and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense has been inferred and proved from these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negative either absolute or qualified in the executive upon the acts of the legislative branches without the one or the other the former would be absolutely unable to defend himself against the depredations of the latter he might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions or annihilated by a single vote and in the one mode or the other the legislative and executive powers might speedily come to be blended in the same hands if even no propensity had ever discovered itself in the legislative body to invade the rights of the executive the rules of just reasoning and theoretic propriety would of themselves teach us that the one ought not to be left to the mercy of the other but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power of selfdefense,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but the power in question has a further use it not only serves as a shield to the executive but it furnishes an additional security against the enaction of improper laws it establishes a salutary check upon the legislative body calculated to guard the community against the effects of faction precipitancy or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good which may happen to influence a majority of that body,"O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the propriety of a negative has upon some occasions been combated by an observation that it was not to be presumed a single man would possess more virtue and wisdom than a number of men and that unless this presumption should be entertained it would be improper to give the executive magistrate any species of control over the legislative body,"O O O O O O , O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> but this observation when examined will appear rather specious than solid the propriety of the thing does not turn upon the supposition of superior wisdom or virtue in the executive but upon the supposition that the legislature will not be infallible that the love of power may sometimes betray it into a disposition to encroach upon the rights of other members of the government that a spirit of faction may sometimes pervert its deliberations that impressions of the moment may sometimes hurry it into measures which itself on maturer reflexion would condemn the primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the executive is to enable him to defend himself the secondary one is to increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws through haste inadvertence or design the oftener the measure is brought under examination the greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it the less must be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation or of those missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest it is far less probable that culpable views of any kind should infect all the parts of the government at the same moment and in relation to the same object than that they should by turns govern and mislead every one of them,"O O O , O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O .

<bos> it may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of preventing good ones and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the other but this objection will have little weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our governments they will consider every institution calculated to restrain the excess of law-making and to keep things in the same state in which they happen to be at any given period as much more likely to do good than harm because it is favorable to greater stability in the system of legislation the injury which may possibly be done by defeating a few good laws will be amply compensated by the advantage of preventing a number of bad ones,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nor is this all the superior weight and influence of the legislative body in a free government and the hazard to the executive in a trial of strength with that body afford a satisfactory security that the negative would generally be employed with great caution and there would oftener be room for a charge of timidity than of rashness in the exercise of it a king of great britain with all his train of sovereign attributes and with all the influence he draws from a thousand sources would at this day hesitate to put a negative upon the joint resolutions of the two houses of parliament he would not fail to exert the utmost resources of that influence to strangle a measure disagreeable to him in its progress to the throne to avoid being reduced to the dilemma of permitting it to take effect or of risking the displeasure of the nation by an opposition to the sense of the legislative body nor is it probable that he would ultimately venture to exert his prerogatives but in a case of manifest propriety or extreme necessity all well-informed men in that kingdom will accede to the justness of this remark a very considerable period has elapsed since the negative of the crown has been exercised,"O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a british monarch would have scruples about the exercise of the power under consideration how much greater caution may be reasonably expected in a president of the united states clothed for the short period of four years with the executive authority of a government wholly and purely republican,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> it is evident that there would be greater danger of his not using his power when necessary than of his using it too often or too much an argument indeed against its expediency has been drawn from this very source it has been represented on this account as a power odious in appearance useless in practice but it will not follow that because it might be rarely exercised it would never be exercised in the case for which it is chiefly designed that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the executive or in a case in which the public good was evidently and palpably sacrificed a man of tolerable firmness would avail himself of his constitutional means of defense and would listen to the admonitions of duty and responsibility in the former supposition his fortitude would be stimulated by his immediate interest in the power of his office in the latter by the probability of the sanction of his constituents who though they would naturally incline to the legislative body in a doubtful case would hardly suffer their partiality to delude them in a very plain case i speak now with an eye to a magistrate possessing only a common share of firmness there are men who under any circumstances will have the courage to do their duty at every hazard,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> but the convention have pursued a mean in this business which will both facilitate the exercise of the power vested in this respect in the executive magistrate and make its efficacy to depend on the sense of a considerable part of the legislative body instead of an absolute negative it is proposed to give the executive the qualified negative already described this is a power which would be much more readily exercised than the other a man who might be afraid to defeat a law by his single veto might not scruple to return it for reconsideration subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of his objections he would be encouraged by the reflection that if his opposition should prevail it would embark in it a very respectable proportion of the legislative body whose influence would be united with his in supporting the propriety of his conduct in the public opinion a direct and categorical negative has something in the appearance of it more harsh and more apt to irritate than the mere suggestion of argumentative objections to be approved or disapproved by those to whom they are addressed in proportion as it would be less apt to offend it would be more apt to be exercised and for this very reason it may in practice be found more effectual it is to be hoped that it will not often happen that improper views will govern so large a proportion as two thirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time and this too in spite of the counterposing weight of the executive it is at any rate far less probable that this should be the case than that such views should taint the resolutions and conduct of a bare majority a power of this nature in the executive will often have a silent and unperceived though forcible operation when men engaged in unjustifiable pursuits are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they can not control they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition from doing what they would with eagerness rush into if no such external impediments were to be feared,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this qualified negative as has been elsewhere remarked is in this state vested in a council consisting of the governor with the chancellor and judges of the supreme court or any two of them it has been freely employed upon a variety of occasions and frequently with success and its utility has become so apparent that persons who in compiling the constitution were violent opposers of it have from experience become its declared admirers.1,"O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> i have in another place remarked that the convention in the formation of this part of their plan had departed from the model of the constitution of this state in favor of that of massachusetts two strong reasons may be imagined for this preference one is that the judges who are to be the interpreters of the law might receive an improper bias from having given a previous opinion in their revisionary capacities the other is that by being often associated with the executive they might be induced to embark too far in the political views of that magistrate and thus a dangerous combination might by degrees be cemented between the executive and judiciary departments it is impossible to keep the judges too distinct from every other avocation than that of expounding the laws it is peculiarly dangerous to place them in a situation to be either corrupted or influenced by the executive,"O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed in a state of disunion from the arms and arts of foreign nations i shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and perhaps still more alarming kind -- those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the states themselves and from domestic factions and convulsions these have been already in some instances slightly anticipated but they deserve a more particular and more full investigation,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> a man must be far gone in utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that if these states should either be wholly disunited or only united in partial confederacies the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other to presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence would be to forget that men are ambitious vindictive and rapacious to look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood would be to disregard the uniform course of human events and to set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the causes of hostility among nations are innumerable there are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion -- the jealousy of power or the desire of equality and safety there are others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their spheres such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations and there are others not less numerous than either of the former which take their origin entirely in private passions in the attachments enmities interests hopes and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members men of this class whether the favorites of a king or of a people have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed and assuming the pretext of some public motive have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification,"O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events either foreign or domestic according to their direction would be an unnecessary waste of time those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn will themselves recollect a variety of instances and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency perhaps however a reference tending to illustrate the general principle may with propriety be made to a case which has lately happened among ourselves if shays had not been a desperate debtor it is much to be doubted whether massachusetts would have been plunged into a civil war,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> is it not we may ask these projectors in politics the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit if this be their true interest have they in fact pursued it has it not on the contrary invariably been found that momentary passions and immediate interest have a more active and imperious control over human conduct than general or remote considerations of policy utility or justice have republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies are not the former administered by men as well as the latter are there not aversions predilections rivalships and desires of unjust acquisitions that affect nations as well as kings are not popular assemblies frequently subject to the impulses of rage resentment jealousy avarice and of other irregular and violent propensities is it not well known that their determinations are often governed by a few individuals in whom they place confidence and are of course liable to be tinctured by the passions and views of those individuals has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the objects of war is not the love of wealth as domineering and enterprising a passion as that of power or glory have there not been as many wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the prevailing system of nations as were before occasioned by the cupidity of territory or dominion has not the spirit of commerce in many instances administered new incentives to the appetite both for the one and for the other let experience the least fallible guide of human opinions be appealed to for an answer to these inquiries,"O O O ( O O O O O O ) O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

"<bos> there have been if i may so express it almost as many popular as royal wars the cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have upon various occasions dragged their monarchs into war or continued them in it contrary to their inclinations and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the state in that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of austria and bourbon which so long kept europe in a flame it is well known that the antipathies of the english against the french seconding the ambition or rather the avarice of a favorite leader,10 protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court","O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> from this summary of what has taken place in other countries whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy in a state of separation have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape is it not time to awake from the deceitful dream of a golden age and to adopt as a practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that we as well as the other inhabitants of the globe are yet remote from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O ?

<bos> so far is the general sense of mankind from corresponding with the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep our apprehensions of discord and hostility between the states in the event of disunion that it has from long observation of the progress of society become a sort of axiom in politics that vicinity or nearness of situation constitutes nations natural enemies an intelligent writer expresses himself on this subject to this effect `` neighboring nations says he are naturally enemies of each other unless their common weakness forces them to league in a confederate republic and their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood occasions extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their neighbors `` 11 this passage at the same time points out the evil and suggests the remedy,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> it may perhaps be urged that the objects enumerated in the preceding number ought to be provided for by the state governments under the direction of the union but this would be in reality an inversion of the primary principle of our political association as it would in practice transfer the care of the common defense from the federal head to the individual members a project oppressive to some states dangerous to all and baneful to the confederacy,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the territories of britain spain and of the indian nations in our neighborhood do not border on particular states but encircle the union from maine to georgia the danger though in different degrees is therefore common and the means of guarding against it ought in like manner to be the objects of common councils and of a common treasury it happens that some states from local situation are more directly exposed new york is of this class upon the plan of separate provisions new york would have to sustain the whole weight of the establishments requisite to her immediate safety and to the mediate or ultimate protection of her neighbors this would neither be equitable as it respected new york nor safe as it respected the other states various inconveniences would attend such a system the states to whose lot it might fall to support the necessary establishments would be as little able as willing for a considerable time to come to bear the burden of competent provisions the security of all would thus be subjected to the parsimony improvidence or inability of a part if the resources of such part becoming more abundant and extensive its provisions should be proportionally enlarged the other states would quickly take the alarm at seeing the whole military force of the union in the hands of two or three of its members and those probably amongst the most powerful they would each choose to have some counterpoise and pretenses could easily be contrived in this situation military establishments nourished by mutual jealousy would be apt to swell beyond their natural or proper size and being at the separate disposal of the members they would be engines for the abridgment or demolition of the national authcrity,"O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> reasons have been already given to induce a supposition that the state governments will too naturally be prone to a rivalship with that of the union the foundation of which will be the love of power and that in any contest between the federal head and one of its members the people will be most apt to unite with their local government if in addition to this immense advantage the ambition of the members should be stimulated by the separate and independent possession of military forces it would afford too strong a temptation and too great a facility to them to make enterprises upon and finally to subvert the constitutional authority of the union on the other hand the liberty of the people would be less safe in this state of things than in that which left the national forces in the hands of the national government as far as an army may be considered as a dangerous weapon of power it had better be in those hands of which the people are most likely to be jealous than in those of which they are least likely to be jealous for it is a truth which the experience of ages has attested that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the framers of the existing confederation fully aware of the danger to the union from the separate possession of military forces by the states have in express terms prohibited them from having either ships or troops unless with the consent of congress the truth is that the existence of a federal government and military establishments under state authority are not less at variance with each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and the system of quotas and requisitions,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> there are other lights besides those already taken notice of in which the impropriety of restraints on the discretion of the national legislature will be equally manifest the design of the objection which has been mentioned is to preclude standing armies in time of peace though we have never been informed how far it is designed the prohibition should extend whether to raising armies as well as to keeping them up in a season of tranquillity or not if it be confined to the latter it will have no precise signification and it will be ineffectual for the purpose intended when armies are once raised what shall be denominated `` keeping them up '' contrary to the sense of the constitution what time shall be requisite to ascertain the violation shall it be a week a month a year or shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which occasioned their being raised continues this would be to admit that they might be kept up in time of peace against threatening or impending danger which would be at once to deviate from the literal meaning of the prohibition and to introduce an extensive latitude of construction who shall judge of the continuance of the danger this must undoubtedly be submitted to the national government and the matter would then be brought to this issue that the national government to provide against apprehended danger might in the first instance raise troops and might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy it is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be founded on the supposed probability or at least possibility of a combination between the executive and the legislative in some scheme of usurpation should this at any time happen how easy would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger indian hostilities instigated by spain or britain would always be at hand provocations to produce the desired appearances might even be given to some foreign power and appeased again by timely concessions if we can reasonably presume such a combination to have been formed and that the enterprise is warranted by a sufficient prospect of success the army when once raised from whatever cause or on whatever pretext may be applied to the execution of the project,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> if to obviate this consequence it should be resolved to extend the prohibition to the raising of armies in time of peace the united states would then exhibit the most extraordinary spectacle which the world has yet seen that of a nation incapacitated by its constitution to prepare for defense before it was actually invaded as the ceremony of a formal denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse the presence of an enemy within our territories must be waited for as the legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the protection of the state we must receive the blow before we could even prepare to return it all that kind of policy by which nations anticipate distant danger and meet the gathering storm must be abstained from as contrary to the genuine maxims of a free government we must expose our property and liberty to the mercy of foreign invaders and invite them by our weakness to seize the naked and defenseless prey because we are afraid that rulers created by our choice dependent on our will might endanger that liberty by an abuse of the means necessary to its preservation,"O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> here i expect we shall be told that the militia of the country is its natural bulwark and would be at all times equal to the national defense this doctrine in substance had like to have lost us our independence it cost millions to the united states that might have been saved the facts which from our own experience forbid a reliance of this kind are too recent to permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion the steady operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind considerations of economy not less than of stability and vigor confirm this position the american militia in the course of the late war have by their valor on numerous occasions erected eternal monuments to their fame but the bravest of them feel and know that the liberty of their country could not have been established by their efforts alone however great and valuable they were war like most other things is a science to be acquired and perfected by diligence by perserverance by time and by practice,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> all violent policy as it is contrary to the natural and experienced course of human affairs defeats itself pennsylvania at this instant affords an example of the truth of this remark the bill of rights of that state declares that standing armies are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be kept up in time of peace pennsylvania nevertheless in a time of profound peace from the existence of partial disorders in one or two of her counties has resolved to raise a body of troops and in all probability will keep them up as long as there is any appearance of danger to the public peace the conduct of massachusetts affords a lesson on the same subject though on different ground that state without waiting for the sanction of congress as the articles of the confederation require was compelled to raise troops to quell a domestic insurrection and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a revival of the spirit of revolt the particular constitution of massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure but the instance is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur under our government as well as under those of other nations which will sometimes render a military force in time of peace essential to the security of the society and that it is therefore improper in this respect to control the legislative discretion it also teaches us in its application to the united states how little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be respected even by its own constituents and it teaches us in addition to the rest how unequal parchment provisions are to a struggle with public necessity..,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O . , O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it was a fundamental maxim of the lacedaemonian commonwealth that the post of admiral should not be conferred twice on the same person the peloponnesian confederates having suffered a severe defeat at sea from the athenians demanded lysander who had before served with success in that capacity to command the combined fleets the lacedaemonians to gratify their allies and yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to their ancient institutions had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing lysander with the real power of admiral under the nominal title of vice-admiral this instance is selected from among a multitude that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and illustrated by domestic examples which is that nations pay little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature to run counter to the necessities of society wise politicians will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions that can not be observed because they know that every breach of the fundamental laws though dictated by necessity impairs that sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast of rulers towards the constitution of a country and forms a precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does not exist at all or is less urgent and palpable,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> although i am of opinion that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem to be apprehended to the state governments from a power in the union to control them in the levies of money because i am persuaded that the sense of the people the extreme hazard of provoking the resentments of the state governments and a conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations for local purposes would be a complete barrier against the oppressive use of such a power yet i am willing here to allow in its full extent the justness of the reasoning which requires that the individual states should possess an independent and uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the supply of their own wants and making this concession i affirm that with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports they would under the plan of the convention retain that authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense and that an attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in the exercise of it would be a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any article or clause of its constitution,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> an entire consolidation of the states into one complete national sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the parts and whatever powers might remain in them would be altogether dependent on the general will but as the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation the state governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had and which were not by that act exclusively delegated to the united states this exclusive delegation or rather this alienation of state sovereignty would only exist in three cases where the constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the union where it granted in one instance an authority to the union and in another prohibited the states from exercising the like authority and where it granted an authority to the union to which a similar authority in the states would be absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant i use these terms to distinguish this last case from another which might appear to resemble it but which would in fact be essentially different i mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences in the policy of any branch of administration but would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority these three cases of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the following instances the last clause but one in the eighth section of the first article provides expressly that congress shall exercise `` exclusive legislation '' over the district to be appropriated as the seat of government this answers to the first case the first clause of the same section empowers congress `` to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises '' and the second clause of the tenth section of the same article declares that `` no state shall without the consent of congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except for the purpose of executing its inspection laws '' hence would result an exclusive power in the union to lay duties on imports and exports with the particular exception mentioned but this power is abridged by another clause which declares that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state in consequence of which qualification it now only extends to the duties on imports this answers to the second case the third will be found in that clause which declares that congress shall have power `` to establish an uniform rule of naturalization throughout the united states '' this must necessarily be exclusive because if each state had power to prescribe a distinct rule there could not be a uniform rule,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> a case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the latter but which is in fact widely different affects the question immediately under consideration i mean the power of imposing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports this i contend is manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority in the united states and in the individual states there is plainly no expression in the granting clause which makes that power exclusive in the union there is no independent clause or sentence which prohibits the states from exercising it so far is this from being the case that a plain and conclusive argument to the contrary is to be deduced from the restraint laid upon the states in relation to duties on imports and exports this restriction implies an admission that if it were not inserted the states would possess the power it excludes and it implies a further admission that as to all other taxes the authority of the states remains undiminished in any other view it would be both unnecessary and dangerous it would be unnecessary because if the grant to the union of the power of laying such duties implied the exclusion of the states or even their subordination in this particular there could be no need of such a restriction it would be dangerous because the introduction of it leads directly to the conclusion which has been mentioned and which if the reasoning of the objectors be just could not have been intended i mean that the states in all cases to which the restriction did not apply would have a concurrent power of taxation with the union the restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a negative pregnant that is a negation of one thing and an affirmance of another a negation of the authority of the states to impose taxes on imports and exports and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other articles it would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to exclude them absolutely from the imposition of taxes of the former kind and to leave them at liberty to lay others subject to the control of the national legislature the restraining or prohibitory clause only says that they shall not without the consent of congress lay such duties and if we are to understand this in the sense last mentioned the constitution would then be made to introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd conclusion which is that the states with the consent of the national legislature might tax imports and exports and that they might tax every other article unless controlled by the same body if this was the intention why not leave it in the first instance to what is alleged to be the natural operation of the original clause conferring a general power of taxation upon the union it is evident that this could not have been the intention and that it will not bear a construction of the kind,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> as to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of taxation in the states and in the union it can not be supported in that sense which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the states it is indeed possible that a tax might be laid on a particular article by a state which might render it inexpedient that thus a further tax should be laid on the same article by the union but it would not imply a constitutional inability to impose a further tax the quantity of the imposition the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either side would be mutually questions of prudence but there would be involved no direct contradiction of power the particular policy of the national and of the state systems of finance might now and then not exactly coincide and might require reciprocal forbearances it is not however a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers but an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the division of the sovereign power and the rule that all authorities of which the states are not explicitly divested in favor of the union remain with them in full vigor is not a theoretical consequence of that division but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the articles of the proposed constitution we there find that notwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities there has been the most pointed care in those cases where it was deemed improper that the like authorities should reside in the states to insert negative clauses prohibiting the exercise of them by the states the tenth section of the first article consists altogether of such provisions this circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the convention and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body of the act which justifies the position i have advanced and refutes every hypothesis to the contrary,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the effects of union upon the commercial prosperity of the states have been sufficiently delineated its tendency to promote the interests of revenue will be the subject of our present inquiry,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .
<bos> the prosperity of commerce is now perceived and acknowledged by all enlightened statesmen to be the most useful as well as the most productive source of national wealth and has accordingly become a primary object of their political cares by multipying the means of gratification by promoting the introduction and circulation of the precious metals those darling objects of human avarice and enterprise it serves to vivify and invigorate the channels of industry and to make them flow with greater activity and copiousness the assiduous merchant the laborious husbandman the active mechanic and the industrious manufacturer -- all orders of men look forward with eager expectation and growing alacrity to this pleasing reward of their toils the often-agitated question between agriculture and commerce has from indubitable experience received a decision which has silenced the rivalship that once subsisted between them and has proved to the satisfaction of their friends that their interests are intimately blended and interwoven it has been found in various countries that in proportion as commerce has flourished land has risen in value and how could it have happened otherwise could that which procures a freer vent for the products of the earth which furnishes new incitements to the cultivation of land which is the most powerful instrument in increasing the quantity of money in a state -- could that in fine which is the faithful handmaid of labor and industry in every shape fail to augment that article which is the prolific parent of far the greatest part of the objects upon which they are exerted it is astonishing that so simple a truth should ever have had an adversary and it is one among a multitude of proofs how apt a spirit of ill-informed jealousy or of too great abstraction and refinement is to lead men astray from the plainest truths of reason and conviction,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the ability of a country to pay taxes must always be proportioned in a great degree to the quantity of money in circulation and to the celerity with which it circulates commerce contributing to both these objects must of necessity render the payment of taxes easier and facilitate the requisite supplies to the treasury the hereditary dominions of the emperor of germany contain a great extent of fertile cultivated and populous territory a large proportion of which is situated in mild and luxuriant climates in some parts of this territory are to be found the best gold and silver mines in europe and yet from the want of the fostering influence of commerce that monarch can boast but slender revenues he has several times been compelled to owe obligations to the pecuniary succors of other nations for the preservation of his essential interests and is unable upon the strength of his own resources to sustain a long or continued war,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . , O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> but it is not in this aspect of the subject alone that union will be seen to conduce to the purpose of revenue there are other points of view in which its influence will appear more immediate and decisive it is evident from the state of the country from the habits of the people from the experience we have had on the point itself that it is impracticable to raise any very considerable sums by direct taxation tax laws have in vain been multiplied new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been tried the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed and the treasuries of the states have remained empty the popular system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated state of trade has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive collections and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of attempting them,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> no person acquainted with what happens in other countries will be surprised at this circumstance in so opulent a nation as that of britain where direct taxes from superior wealth must be much more tolerable and from the vigor of the government much more practicable than in america far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind from imposts and from excises duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in america it is evident that we must a long time depend for the means of revenue chiefly on such duties in most parts of it excises must be confined within a narrow compass the genius of the people will ill brook the inquisitive and peremptory spirit of excise laws the pockets of the farmers on the other hand will reluctantly yield but scanty supplies in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their houses and lands and personal property is too precarious and invisible a fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the inperceptible agency of taxes on consumption,"O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if these remarks have any foundation that state of things which will best enable us to improve and extend so valuable a resource must be best adapted to our political welfare and it can not admit of a serious doubt that this state of things must rest on the basis of a general union as far as this would be conducive to the interests of commerce so far it must tend to the extension of the revenue to be drawn from that source as far as it would contribute to rendering regulations for the collection of the duties more simple and efficacious so far it must serve to answer the purposes of making the same rate of duties more productive and of putting it into the power of the government to increase the rate without prejudice to trade,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the relative situation of these states the number of rivers with which they are intersected and of bays that wash there shores the facility of communication in every direction the affinity of language and manners the familiar habits of intercourse -- all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other the separate states or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties the temper of our governments for a long time to come would not permit those rigorous precautions by which the european nations guard the avenues into their respective countries as well by land as by water and which even there are found insufficient obstacles to the adventurous stratagems of avarice,"O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in france there is an army of patrols as they are called constantly employed to secure their fiscal regulations against the inroads of the dealers in contraband trade mr. neckar computes the number of these patrols at upwards of twenty thousand this shows the immense difficulty in preventing that species of traffic where there is an inland communication and places in a strong light the disadvantages with which the collection of duties in this country would be encumbered if by disunion the states should be placed in a situation with respect to each other resembling that of france with respect to her neighbors the arbitrary and vexatious powers with which the patrols are necessarily armed would be intolerable in a free country,"O O , O O O O O ( O O O ) O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if on the contrary there be but one government pervading all the states there will be as to the principal part of our commerce but one side to guard -- the atlantic coast vessels arriving directly from foreign countries laden with valuable cargoes would rarely choose to hazard themselves to the complicated and critical perils which would attend attempts to unlade prior to their coming into port they would have to dread both the dangers of the coast and of detection as well after as before their arrival at the places of their final destination an ordinary degree of vigilance would be competent to the prevention of any material infractions upon the rights of the revenue a few armed vessels judiciously stationed at the entrances of our ports might at a small expense be made useful sentinels of the laws and the government having the same interest to provide against violations everywhere the co-operation of its measures in each state would have a powerful tendency to render them effectual here also we should preserve by union an advantage which nature holds out to us and which would be relinquished by separation the united states lie at a great distance from europe and at a considerable distance from all other places with which they would have extensive connections of foreign trade the passage from them to us in a few hours or in a single night as between the coasts of france and britain and of other neighboring nations would be impracticable this is a prodigious security against a direct contraband with foreign countries but a circuitous contraband to one state through the medium of another would be both easy and safe the difference between a direct importation from abroad and an indirect importation through the channel of a neighboring state in small parcels according to time and opportunity with the additional facilities of inland communication must be palpable to every man of discernment,"O , O O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is therefore evident that one national government would be able at much less expense to extend the duties on imports beyond comparison further than would be practicable to the states separately or to any partial confederacies hitherto i believe it may safely be asserted that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any state three per cent in france they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent. and in britain they exceed this proportion.1 there seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their present amount the single article of ardent spirits under federal regulation might be made to furnish a considerable revenue upon a ratio to the importation into this state the whole quantity imported into the united states may be estimated at four millions of gallons which at a shilling per gallon would produce two hundred thousand pounds that article would well bear this rate of duty and if it should tend to diminish the consumption of it such an effect would be equally favorable to the agriculture to the economy to the morals and to the health of the society there is perhaps nothing so much a subject of national extravagance as these spirits,"O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O . , O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> what will be the consequence if we are not able to avail ourselves of the resource in question in its full extent a nation can not long exist without revenues destitute of this essential support it must resign its independence and sink into the degraded condition of a province this is an extremity to which no government will of choice accede revenue therefore must be had at all events in this country if the principal part be not drawn from commerce it must fall with oppressive weight upon land it has been already intimated that excises in their true signification are too little in unison with the feelings of the people to admit of great use being made of that mode of taxation nor indeed in the states where almost the sole employment is agriculture are the objects proper for excise sufficiently numerous to permit very ample collections in that way personal estate as has been before remarked from the difficulty in tracing it can not be subjected to large contributions by any other means than by taxes on consumption in populous cities it may be enough the subject of conjecture to occasion the oppression of individuals without much aggregate benefit to the state but beyond these circles it must in a great measure escape the eye and the hand of the tax-gatherer as the necessities of the state nevertheless must be satisfied in some mode or other the defect of other resources must throw the principal weight of public burdens on the possessors of land and as on the other hand the wants of the government can never obtain an adequate supply unless all the sources of revenue are open to its demands the finances of the community under such embarrassments can not be put into a situation consistent with its respectability or its security thus we shall not even have the consolations of a full treasury to atone for the oppression of that valuable class of the citizens who are employed in the cultivation of the soil but public and private distress will keep pace with each other in gloomy concert and unite in deploring the infatuation of those counsels which led to disunion,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> let us now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other `` the judicial power of the united states is '' by the plan of the convention `` to be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish `` 1,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ( O O O O O ) O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O .

<bos> that there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction is a proposition which is not likely to be contested the reasons for it have been assigned in another place and are too obvious to need repetition the only question that seems to have been raised concerning it is whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the legislature the same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in several other cases the very men who object to the senate as a court of impeachments on the ground of an improper intermixture of powers advocate by implication at least the propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes in the whole or in a part of the legislative body,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the arguments or rather suggestions upon which this charge is founded are to this effect `` the authority of the proposed supreme court of the united states which is to be a separate and independent body will be superior to that of the legislature the power of construing the laws according to the spirit of the constitution will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think proper especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body this is as unprecedented as it is dangerous in britain the judical power in the last resort resides in the house of lords which is a branch of the legislature and this part of the british government has been imitated in the state constitutions in general the parliament of great britain and the legislatures of the several states can at any time rectify by law the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts but the errors and usurpations of the supreme court of the united states will be uncontrollable and remediless '' this upon examination will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact,"O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the first place there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the constitution or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every state i admit however that the constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws and that wherever there is an evident opposition the laws ought to give place to the constitution but this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention but from the general theory of a limited constitution and as far as it is true is equally applicable to most if not to all the state governments there can be no objection therefore on this account to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in general and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular organization of the supreme court in its being composed of a distinct body of magistrates instead of being one of the branches of the legislature as in the government of great britain and that of the state to insist upon this point the authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated maxim requiring a separation of the departments of power it shall nevertheless be conceded to them agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a part of the legislative body but though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule yet it verges so nearly upon it as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention from a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application the same spirit which had operated in making them would be too apt in interpreting them still less could it be expected that men who had infringed the constitution in the character of legislators would be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges nor is this all every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial offices militates against placing the judiciary power in the last resort in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period there is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes in the first instance to judges of permanent standing in the last to those of a temporary and mutable constitution and there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men selected for their knowledge of the laws acquired by long and laborious study to the revision and control of men who for want of the same advantage can not but be deficient in that knowledge the members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges and as on this account there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information so on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice the habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of equity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> these considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those states who have committed the judicial power in the last resort not to a part of the legislature but to distinct and independent bodies of men contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the convention in this respect as novel and unprecedented it is but a copy of the constitutions of new hampshire massachusetts pennsylvania delaware maryland virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia and the preference which has been given to those models is highly to be commended,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is not true in the second place that the parliament of great britain or the legislatures of the particular states can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the united states the theory neither of the british nor the state constitutions authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act nor is there any thing in the proposed constitution more than in either of them by which it is forbidden in the former as well as in the latter the impropriety of the thing on the general principles of law and reason is the sole obstacle a legislature without exceeding its province can not reverse a determination once made in a particular case though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases this is the principle and it applies in all its consequences exactly in the same manner and extent to the state governments as to the national government now under consideration not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject,"O O O O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority which has been upon many occasions reiterated is in reality a phantom particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system this may be inferred with certainty from the general nature of the judicial power from the objects to which it relates from the manner in which it is exercised from its comparative weakness and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force and the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body and of determining upon them in the other would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department this is alone a complete security there never can be danger that the judges by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption by degrading them from their stations while this ought to remove all apprehensions on the subject it affords at the same time a cogent argument for constituting the senate a court for the trial of impeachments,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O .

"<bos> having now examined and i trust removed the objections to the distinct and independent organization of the supreme court i proceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior courts,2 and the relations which will subsist between these and the former","O O O , , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the supreme court in every case of federal cognizance it is intended to enable the national government to institute or authoruze in each state or district of the united states a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national jurisdiction within its limits,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> but why it is asked might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the instrumentality of the state courts this admits of different answers though the fitness and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude yet the substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan if it were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out of the national constitution to confer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the several states would perhaps be as much `` to constitute tribunals '' as to create new courts with the like power but ought not a more direct and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the state courts there are in my opinion substantial reasons against such a provision the most discerning can not foresee how far the prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the jurisdiction of national causes whilst every man may discover that courts constituted like those of some of the states would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the union state judges holding their offices during pleasure or from year to year will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws and if there was a necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as possible in proportion to the grounds of confidence in or distrust of the subordinate tribunals ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals and well satisfied as i am of the propriety of the appellate jurisdiction in the several classes of causes to which it is extended by the plan of the convention i should consider every thing calculated to give in practice an unrestrained course to appeals as a source of public and private inconvenience,"O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> i am not sure but that it will be found highly expedient and useful to divide the united states into four or five or half a dozen districts and to institute a federal court in each district in lieu of one in every state the judges of these courts with the aid of the state judges may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts of the respective districts justice through them may be administered with ease and despatch and appeals may be safely circumscribed within a narrow compass this plan appears to me at present the most eligible of any that could be adopted and in order to it it is necessary that the power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be found in the proposed constitution,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> these reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind that the want of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the union the supreme court is to be invested with original jurisdiction only `` in cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls and those in which a state shall be a party '' public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns all questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the public peace that as well for the preservation of this as out of respect to the sovereignties they represent it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic character yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them in cases in which a state might happen to be a party it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this paper i shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds it has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one state to the citizens of another would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent this is the general sense and the general practice of mankind and the exemption as one of the attributes of sovereignty is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union unless therefore there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention it will remain with the states and the danger intimated must be merely ideal the circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation and need not be repeated here a recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us that there is no color to pretend that the state governments would by the adoption of that plan be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith the contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to a compulsive force they confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will to what purpose would it be to authorize suits against states for the debts they owe how could recoveries be enforced it is evident it could not be done without waging war against the contracting state and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state governments a power which would involve such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> let us resume the train of our observations we have seen that the original jurisdiction of the supreme court would be confined to two classes of causes and those of a nature rarely to occur in all other cases of federal cognizance the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals and the supreme court would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction `` with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make '',"O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O"
<bos> the propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact some well-intentioned men in this state deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury in favor of the civil-law mode of trial which prevails in our courts of admiralty probate and chancery a technical sense has been affixed to the term `` appellate '' which in our law parlance is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law but if i am not misinformed the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of new england there an appeal from one jury to another is familiar both in language and practice and is even a matter of course until there have been two verdicts on one side the word `` appellate '' therefore will not be understood in the same sense in new england as in new york which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular state the expression taken in the abstract denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another either as to the law or fact or both the mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision in a new government it must depend on the latter and may be with or without the aid of a jury as may be judged advisable if therefore the re-examination of a fact once determined by a jury should in any case be admitted under the proposed constitution it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact or by directing an issue immediately out of the supreme court,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , , O . O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a jury will be permitted in the supreme court why may not it be said with the strictest propriety when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this state that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law it is true it can not institute a new inquiry concerning the fact but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record and pronounces the law arising upon it.3 this is jurisdiction of both fact and law nor is it even possible to separate them though the common-law courts of this state ascertain disputed facts by a jury yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact and law and accordingly when the former is agreed in the pleadings they have no recourse to a jury but proceed at once to judgment i contend therefore on this ground that the expressions `` appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact '' do not necessarily imply a re-examination in the supreme court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O .

<bos> the following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention in relation to this particular provision the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court it may have been argued will extend to causes determinable in different modes some in the course of the common law others in the course of the civil law in the former the revision of the law only will be generally speaking the proper province of the supreme court in the latter the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage and in some cases of which prize causes are an example might be essential to the preservation of the public peace it is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should in certain cases extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact it will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury because in the courts of some of the states all causes are tried in this mode4 and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of fact as well where it might be proper as where it might be improper to avoid all inconveniencies it will be safest to declare generally that the supreme court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such exceptions and regulations as the national legislature may prescribe this will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of public justice and security,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O ( O O O O ) O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O ; O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this view of the matter at any rate puts it out of all doubt that the supposed abolition of the trial by jury by the operation of this provision is fallacious and untrue the legislature of the united states would certainly have full power to provide that in appeals to the supreme court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries this would certainly be an authorized exception but if for the reason already intimated it should be thought too extensive it might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial,"O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O .

<bos> the amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national judicature that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the supreme court and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals that the supreme court will possess an appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact in all the cases referred to them both subject to any exceptions and regulations which may be thought advisable that this appellate jurisdiction does in no case abolish the trial by jury and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed judiciary without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that source,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O , O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."

<bos> it has been mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the co-operation of the senate in the business of appointments that it would contribute to the stability of the administration the consent of that body would be necessary to displace as well as to appoint a change of the chief magistrate therefore would not occasion so violent or so general a revolution in the officers of the government as might be expected if he were the sole disposer of offices where a man in any station had given satisfactory evidence of his fitness for it a new president would be restrained from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable to him by the apprehension that a discountenance of the senate might frustrate the attempt and bring some degree of discredit upon himself those who can best estimate the value of a steady administration will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men with the approbation or disapprobation of that body which from the greater permanency of its own composition will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of the government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to this union of the senate with the president in the article of appointments it has in some cases been suggested that it would serve to give the president an undue influence over the senate and in others that it would have an opposite tendency a strong proof that neither suggestion is true,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> to state the first in its proper form is to refute it it amounts to this the president would have an improper influence over the senate because the senate would have the power of restraining him this is an absurdity in terms it can not admit of a doubt that the entire power of appointment would enable him much more effectually to establish a dangerous empire over that body than a mere power of nomination subject to their control,"O O O O O O O O , O O O . O O O : O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> let us take a view of the converse of the proposition `` the senate would influence the executive '' as i have had occasion to remark in several other instances the indistinctness of the objection forbids a precise answer in what manner is this influence to be exerted in relation to what objects the power of influencing a person in the sense in which it is here used must imply a power of conferring a benefit upon him how could the senate confer a benefit upon the president by the manner of employing their right of negative upon his nominations if it be said they might sometimes gratify him by an acquiescence in a favorite choice when public motives might dictate a different conduct i answer that the instances in which the president could be personally interested in the result would be too few to admit of his being materially affected by the compliances of the senate the power which can originate the disposition of honors and emoluments is more likely to attract than to be attracted by the power which can merely obstruct their course if by influencing the president be meant restraining him this is precisely what must have been intended and it has been shown that the restraint would be salutary at the same time that it would not be such as to destroy a single advantage to be looked for from the uncontrolled agency of that magistrate the right of nomination would produce all the good of that of appointment and would in a great measure avoid its evils upon a comparison of the plan for the appointment of the officers of the proposed government with that which is established by the constitution of this state a decided preference must be given to the former in that plan the power of nomination is unequivocally vested in the executive and as there would be a necessity for submitting each nomination to the judgment of an entire branch of the legislature the circumstances attending an appointment from the mode of conducting it would naturally become matters of notoriety and the public would be at no loss to determine what part had been performed by the different actors the blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president singly and absolutely the censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate aggravated by the consideration of their having counteracted the good intentions of the executive if an ill appointment should be made the executive for nominating and the senate for approving would participate though in different degrees in the opprobrium and disgrace,"O O O O O O O O O O O : O O O O O O .

<bos> the reverse of all this characterizes the manner of appointment in this state the council of appointment consists of from three to five persons of whom the governor is always one this small body shut up in a private apartment impenetrable to the public eye proceed to the execution of the trust committed to them it is known that the governor claims the right of nomination upon the strength of some ambiguous expressions in the constitution but it is not known to what extent or in what manner he exercises it nor upon what occasions he is contradicted or opposed the censure of a bad appointment on account of the uncertainty of its author and for want of a determinate object has neither poignancy nor duration and while an unbounded field for cabal and intrigue lies open all idea of responsibility is lost the most that the public can know is that the governor claims the right of nomination that two out of the inconsiderable number of four men can too often be managed without much difficulty that if some of the members of a particular council should happen to be of an uncomplying character it is frequently not impossible to get rid of their opposition by regulating the times of meeting in such a manner as to render their attendance inconvenient and that from whatever cause it may proceed a great number of very improper appointments are from time to time made whether a governor of this state avails himself of the ascendant he must necessarily have in this delicate and important part of the administration to prefer to offices men who are best qualified for them or whether he prostitutes that advantage to the advancement of persons whose chief merit is their implicit devotion to his will and to the support of a despicable and dangerous system of personal influence are questions which unfortunately for the community can only be the subjects of speculation and conjecture,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> every mere council of appointment however constituted will be a conclave in which cabal and intrigue will have their full scope their number without an unwarrantable increase of expense can not be large enough to preclude a facility of combination and as each member will have his friends and connections to provide for the desire of mutual gratification will beget a scandalous bartering of votes and bargaining for places the private attachments of one man might easily be satisfied but to satisfy the private attachments of a dozen or of twenty men would occasion a monopoly of all the principal employments of the government in a few families and would lead more directly to an aristocracy or an oligarchy than any measure that could be contrived if to avoid an accumulation of offices there was to be a frequent change in the persons who were to compose the council this would involve the mischiefs of a mutable administration in their full extent such a council would also be more liable to executive influence than the senate because they would be fewer in number and would act less immediately under the public inspection such a council in fine as a substitute for the plan of the convention would be productive of an increase of expense a multiplication of the evils which spring from favoritism and intrigue in the distribution of public honors a decrease of stability in the administration of the government and a diminution of the security against an undue influence of the executive and yet such a council has been warmly contended for as an essential amendment in the proposed constitution,"O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i could not with propriety conclude my observations on the subject of appointments without taking notice of a scheme for which there have appeared some though but few advocates i mean that of uniting the house of representatives in the power of making them i shall however do little more than mention it as i can not imagine that it is likely to gain the countenance of any considerable part of the community a body so fluctuating and at the same time so numerous can never be deemed proper for the exercise of that power its unfitness will appear manifest to all when it is recollected that in half a century it may consist of three or four hundred persons all the advantages of the stability both of the executive and of the senate would be defeated by this union and infinite delays and embarrassments would be occasioned the example of most of the states in their local constitutions encourages us to reprobate the idea,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the only remaining powers of the executive are comprehended in giving information to congress of the state of the union in recommending to their consideration such measures as he shall judge expedient in convening them or either branch upon extraordinary occasions in adjourning them when they can not themselves agree upon the time of adjournment in receiving ambassadors and other public ministers in faithfully executing the laws and in commissioning all the officers of the united states,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O , O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O ; O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> except some cavils about the power of convening either house of the legislature and that of receiving ambassadors no objection has been made to this class of authorities nor could they possibly admit of any it required indeed an insatiable avidity for censure to invent exceptions to the parts which have been excepted to in regard to the power of convening either house of the legislature i shall barely remark that in respect to the senate at least we can readily discover a good reason for it as this body has a concurrent power with the executive in the article of treaties it might often be necessary to call it together with a view to this object when it would be unnecessary and improper to convene the house of representatives as to the reception of ambassadors what i have said in a former paper will furnish a sufficient answer,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O .

<bos> we have now completed a survey of the structure and powers of the executive department which i have endeavored to show combines as far as republican principles will admit all the requisites to energy the remaining inquiry is does it also combine the requisites to safety in a republican sense a due dependence on the people a due responsibility the answer to this question has been anticipated in the investigation of its other characteristics and is satisfactorily deducible from these circumstances from the election of the president once in four years by persons immediately chosen by the people for that purpose and from his being at all times liable to impeachment trial dismission from office incapacity to serve in any other and to forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution in the common course of law but these precautions great as they are are not the only ones which the plan of the convention has provided in favor of the public security in the only instances in which the abuse of the executive authority was materially to be feared the chief magistrate of the united states would by that plan be subjected to the control of a branch of the legislative body what more could be desired by an enlightened and reasonable people,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O , , O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> it is sometimes asked with an air of seeming triumph what inducements could the states have if disunited to make war upon each other it would be a full answer to this question to say -- precisely the same inducements which have at different times deluged in blood all the nations in the world but unfortunately for us the question admits of a more particular answer there are causes of differences within our immediate contemplation of the tendency of which even under the restraints of a federal constitution we have had sufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were removed,"O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O , O O O O O ?

<bos> territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most fertile sources of hostility among nations perhaps the greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have sprung from this origin this cause would exist among us in full force we have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the boundaries of the united states there still are discordant and undecided claims between several of them and the dissolution of the union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them all it is well known that they have heretofore had serious and animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were ungranted at the time of the revolution and which usually went under the name of crown lands the states within the limits of whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them as their property the others have contended that the rights of the crown in this article devolved upon the union especially as to all that part of the western territory which either by actual possession or through the submission of the indian proprietors was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of great britain till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace this it has been said was at all events an acquisition to the confederacy by compact with a foreign power it has been the prudent policy of congress to appease this controversy by prevailing upon the states to make cessions to the united states for the benefit of the whole this has been so far accomplished as under a continuation of the union to afford a decided prospect of an amicable termination of the dispute a dismemberment of the confederacy however would revive this dispute and would create others on the same subject at present a large part of the vacant western territory is by cession at least if not by any anterior right the common property of the union if that were at an end the states which made the cession on a principle of federal compromise would be apt when the motive of the grant had ceased to reclaim the lands as a reversion the other states would no doubt insist on a proportion by right of representation their argument would be that a grant once made could not be revoked and that the justice of participating in territory acquired or secured by the joint efforts of the confederacy remained undiminished if contrary to probability it should be admitted by all the states that each had a right to a share of this common stock there would still be a difficulty to be surmounted as to a proper rule of apportionment different principles would be set up by different states for this purpose and as they would affect the opposite interests of the parties they might not easily be susceptible of a pacific adjustment,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the wide field of western territory therefore we perceive an ample theatre for hostile pretensions without any umpire or common judge to interpose between the contending parties to reason from the past to the future we shall have good ground to apprehend that the sword would sometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences the circumstances of the dispute between connecticut and pennsylvania respecting the land at wyoming admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy accommodation of such differences the articles of confederation obliged the parties to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court the submission was made and the court decided in favor of pennsylvania but connecticut gave strong indications of dissatisfaction with that determination nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to it till by negotiation and management something like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed herself to have sustained nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure on the conduct of that state she no doubt sincerely believed herself to have been injured by the decision and states like individuals acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations to their disadvantage,"O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions which attended the progress of the controversy between this state and the district of vermont can vouch the opposition we experienced as well from states not interested as from those which were interested in the claim and can attest the danger to which the peace of the confederacy might have been exposed had this state attempted to assert its rights by force two motives preponderated in that opposition one a jealousy entertained of our future power and the other the interest of certain individuals of influence in the neighboring states who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government of that district even the states which brought forward claims in contradiction to ours seemed more solicitous to dismember this state than to establish their own pretensions these were new hampshire massachusetts and connecticut new jersey and rhode island upon all occasions discovered a warm zeal for the independence of vermont and maryland till alarmed by the appearance of a connection between canada and that state entered deeply into the same views these being small states saw with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness in a review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes which would be likely to embroil the states with each other if it should be their unpropitious destiny to become disunited,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention the states less favorably circumstanced would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation and of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors each state or separate confederacy would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself this would occasion distinctions preferences and exclusions which would beget discontent the habits of intercourse on the basis of equal privileges to which we have been accustomed since the earliest settlement of the country would give a keener edge to those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this circumstance we should be ready to denominate injuries those things which were in reality the justifiable acts of independent sovereignties consulting a distinct interest the spirit of enterprise which characterizes the commercial part of america has left no occasion of displaying itself unimproved it is not at all probable that this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations of trade by which particular states might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to their own citizens the infractions of these regulations on one side the efforts to prevent and repel them on the other would naturally lead to outrages and these to reprisals and wars,"O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the opportunities which some states would have of rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently submitted to by the tributary states the relative situation of new york connecticut and new jersey would afford an example of this kind new york from the necessities of revenue must lay duties on her importations a great part of these duties must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other states in the capacity of consumers of what we import new york would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors nor would it be practicable if there were not this impediment in the way to distinguish the customers in our own markets would connecticut and new jersey long submit to be taxed by new york for her exclusive benefit should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors and in their opinion so oppressive should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of connecticut on the one side and the co-operating pressure of new jersey on the other these are questions that temerity alone will answer in the affirmative,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the public debt of the union would be a further cause of collision between the separate states or confederacies the apportionment in the first instance and the progressive extinguishment afterward would be alike productive of ill-humor and animosity how would it be possible to agree upon a rule of apportionment satisfactory to all there is scarcely any that can be proposed which is entirely free from real objections these as usual would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the parties there are even dissimilar views among the states as to the general principle of discharging the public debt some of them either less impressed with the importance of national credit or because their citizens have little if any immediate interest in the question feel an indifference if not a repugnance to the payment of the domestic debt at any rate these would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a distribution others of them a numerous body of whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond proportion of the state in the total amount of the national debt would be strenuous for some equitable and effective provision the procrastinations of the former would excite the resentments of the latter the settlement of a rule would in the meantime be postponed by real differences of opinion and affected delays the citizens of the states interested would clamour foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of their just demands and the peace of the states would be hazarded to the double contingency of external invasion and internal contention,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule surmounted and the apportionment made still there is great room to suppose that the rule agreed upon would upon experiment be found to bear harder upon some states than upon others those which were sufferers by it would naturally seek for a mitigation of the burden the others would as naturally be disinclined to a revision which was likely to end in an increase of their own incumbrances their refusal would be too plausible a pretext to the complaining states to withhold their contributions not to be embraced with avidity and the non-compliance of these states with their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and altercation if even the rule adopted should in practice justify the equality of its principle still delinquencies in payments on the part of some of the states would result from a diversity of other causes -- the real deficiency of resources the mismanagement of their finances accidental disorders in the management of the government and in addition to the rest the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them and interfere with the supply of immediate wants delinquencies from whatever causes would be productive of complaints recriminations and quarrels there is perhaps nothing more likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not yield an equal and coincident benefit for it is an observation as true as it is trite that there is nothing men differ so readily about as the payment of money,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O .
