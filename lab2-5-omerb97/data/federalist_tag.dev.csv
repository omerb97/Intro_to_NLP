<bos> the second class of powers lodged in the general government consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations to wit to make treaties to send and receive ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations to regulate foreign commerce including a power to prohibit after the year 1808 the importation of slaves and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars per head as a discouragement to such importations this class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration if we are to be one nation in any respect it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations the powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors speak their own propriety both of them are comprised in the articles of confederation with this difference only that the former is disembarrassed by the plan of the convention of an exception under which treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the states and that a power of appointing and receiving `` other public ministers and consuls '' is expressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning ambassadors,"O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O : O O ; O O O O , O O , O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ; O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the term ambassador if taken strictly as seems to be required by the second of the articles of confederation comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers and excludes the grades which the united states will be most likely to prefer where foreign embassies may be necessary and under no latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls yet it has been found expedient and has been the practice of congress to employ the inferior grades of public ministers and to send and receive consuls it is true that where treaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls whose functions are connected with commerce the admission of foreign consuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties and that where no such treaties exist the mission of american consuls into foreign countries may perhaps be covered under the authority given by the ninth article of the confederation to appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the united states but the admission of consuls into the united states where no previous treaty has stipulated it seems to have been nowhere provided for,"O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> a supply of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the convention have improved on the model before them but the most minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations of power a list of the cases in which congress have been betrayed or forced by the defects of the confederation into violations of their chartered authorities would not a little surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject and would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new constitution which seems to have provided no less studiously for the lesser than the more obvious and striking defects of the old the power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations belongs with equal propriety to the general government and is a still greater improvement on the articles of confederation these articles contain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of nations and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the confederacy with foreign nations,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the provision of the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these offenses the definition of piracies might perhaps without inconveniency be left to the law of nations though a legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes a definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite felony is a term of loose signification even in the common law of england and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom but neither the common nor the statute law of that or of any other nation ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this unless previously made its own by legislative adoption the meaning of the term as defined in the codes of the several states would be as impracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide it is not precisely the same in any two of the states and varies in each with every revision of its criminal laws for the sake of certainty and uniformity therefore the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the regulation of foreign commerce having fallen within several views which have been taken of this subject has been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the federal administration it were doubtless to be wished that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808 or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation but it is not difficult to account either for this restriction on the general government or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed it ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity that a period of twenty years may terminate forever within these states a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy that within that period it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government and may be totally abolished by a concurrence of the few states which continue the unnatural traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the union happy would it be for the unfortunate africans if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their european brethren attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the constitution by representing it on one side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice and on another as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from europe to america i mention these misconstructions not with a view to give them an answer for they deserve none but as specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed government,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the powers included in the third class are those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the states under this head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the authority of the states and certain powers of the judicial department but the former are reserved for a distinct class and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and organization of the government i shall confine myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third description to wit to regulate commerce among the several states and the indian tribes to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and secureties of the united states to fix the standard of weights and measures to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws of bankruptcy to prescribe the manner in which the public acts records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the effect they shall have in other states and to establish post offices and post roads the defect of power in the existing confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by experience,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this subject it may be added that without this supplemental provision the great and essential power of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and ineffectual a very material object of this power was the relief of the states which import and export through other states from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter were these at liberty to regulate the trade between state and state it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export during the passage through their jurisdiction with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former we may be assured by past experience that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs that it would nourish unceasing animosities and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to those who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of interest the desire of the commercial states to collect in any form an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors must appear not less impolitic than it is unfair since it would stimulate the injured party by resentment as well as interest to resort to less convenient channels for their foreign trade but the mild voice of reason pleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest is but too often drowned before public bodies as well as individuals by the clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain the necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated states has been illustrated by other examples as well as our own in switzerland where the union is so very slight each canton is obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other cantons without an augmentation of the tolls in germany it is a law of the empire that the princes and states shall not lay tolls or customs on bridges rivers or passages without the consent of the emperor and the diet though it appears from a quotation in an antecedent paper that the practice in this as in many other instances in that confederacy has not followed the law and has produced there the mischiefs which have been foreseen here among the restraints imposed by the union of the netherlands on its members one is that they shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors without the general permission,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the regulation of commerce with the indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of confederation which render the provision obscure and contradictory the power is there restrained to indians not members of any of the states and is not to violate or infringe the legislative right of any state within its own limits what description of indians are to be deemed members of a state is not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with indians though not members of a state yet residing within its legislative jurisdiction can be regulated by an external authority without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation is absolutely incomprehensible this is not the only case in which the articles of confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish impossibilities to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the union with complete sovereignty in the states to subvert a mathematical axiom by taking away a part and letting the whole remain,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> all that need be remarked on the power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin is that by providing for this last case the constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of confederation the authority of the existing congress is restrained to the regulation of coin struck by their own authority or that of the respective states it must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity in the value of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different states the punishment of counterfeiting the public securities as well as the current coin is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure the value of both the regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles of confederation and is founded on like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O , , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked as a fault in our system and as laying a foundation for intricate and delicate questions in the fourth article of the confederation it is declared `` that the free inhabitants of each of these states paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states and the people of each state shall in every other enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce '' etc there is a confusion of language here which is remarkable why the terms free inhabitants are used in one part of the article free citizens in another and people in another or what was meant by superadding to `` all privileges and immunities of free citizens '' `` all the privileges of trade and commerce '' can not easily be determined it seems to be a construction scarcely avoidable however that those who come under the denomination of free inhabitants of a state although not citizens of such state are entitled in every other state to all the privileges of free citizens of the latter that is to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own state so that it may be in the power of a particular state or rather every state is laid under a necessity not only to confer the rights of citizenship in other states upon any whom it may admit to such rights within itself but upon any whom it may allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction but were an exposition of the term `` inhabitants '' to be admitted which would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone the difficulty is diminished only not removed the very improper power would still be retained by each state of naturalizing aliens in every other state in one state residence for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship in another qualifications of greater importance are required an alien therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter may by previous residence only in the former elude his incapacity and thus the law of one state be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another within the jurisdiction of the other,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> we owe it to mere casualty that very serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped by the laws of several states certain descriptions of aliens who had rendered themselves obnoxious were laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of residence what would have been the consequence if such persons by residence or otherwise had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another state and then asserted their rights as such both to residence and citizenship within the state proscribing them whatever the legal consequences might have been other consequences would probably have resulted of too serious a nature not to be provided against the new constitution has accordingly with great propriety made provision against them and all others proceeding from the defect of the confederation on this head by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the united states the power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different states that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question the power of prescribing by general laws the manner in which the public acts records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the effect they shall have in other states is an evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of confederation the meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear the power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous states where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated in any stage of the process within a foreign jurisdiction the power of establishing post roads must in every view be a harmless power and may perhaps by judicious management become productive of great public conveniency nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the states can be deemed unworthy of the public care,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> having reviewed the general form of the proposed government and the general mass of power allotted to it i proceed to examine the particular structure of this government and the distribution of this mass of power among its constituent parts one of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the constitution is its supposed violation of the political maxim that the legislative executive and judiciary departments ought to be separate and distinct in the structure of the federal government no regard it is said seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty the several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts no political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny were the federal constitution therefore really chargeable with the accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system i persuade myself however that it will be made apparent to every one that the charge can not be supported and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied in order to form correct ideas on this important subject it will be proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct the oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the celebrated montesquieu if he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of mankind let us endeavor in the first place to ascertain his meaning on this point the british constitution was to montesquieu what homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry as the latter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn and by which all similar works were to be judged so this great political critic appears to have viewed the constitution of england as the standard or to use his own expression as the mirror of political liberty and to have delivered in the form of elementary truths the several characteristic principles of that particular system that we may be sure then not to mistake his meaning in this case let us recur to the source from which the maxim was drawn,"O O O O O , , , O , O O O , O O , O , O , O O , , O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> on the slightest view of the british constitution we must perceive that the legislative executive and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other the executive magistrate forms an integral part of the legislative authority he alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns which when made have under certain limitations the force of legislative acts all the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him can be removed by him on the address of the two houses of parliament and form when he pleases to consult them one of his constitutional councils one branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional council to the executive chief as on another hand it is the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment and is invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases the judges again are so far connected with the legislative department as often to attend and participate in its deliberations though not admitted to a legislative vote from these facts by which montesquieu was guided it may clearly be inferred that in saying `` there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates '' or `` if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers '' he did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in or no control over the acts of each other his meaning as his own words import and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye can amount to no more than this that where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of another department the fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted this would have been the case in the constitution examined by him if the king who is the sole executive magistrate had possessed also the complete legislative power or the supreme administration of justice or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme judiciary or the supreme executive authority,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> this however is not among the vices of that constitution the magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides can not of himself make a law though he can put a negative on every law nor administer justice in person though he has the appointment of those who do administer it the judges can exercise no executive prerogative though they are shoots from the executive stock nor any legislative function though they may be advised with by the legislative councils the entire legislature can perform no judiciary act though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their offices and though one of its branches is possessed of the judicial power in the last resort the entire legislature again can exercise no executive prerogative though one of its branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy and another on the impeachment of a third can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the executive department the reasons on which montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning `` when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body '' says he `` there can be no liberty because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner. `` again `` were the power of judging joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control for the judge would then be the legislator were it joined to the executive power the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor. `` some of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages but briefly stated as they are here they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author,"O , , O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we look into the constitutions of the several states we find that notwithstanding the emphatical and in some instances the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct new hampshire whose constitution was the last formed seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments and has qualified the doctrine by declaring `` that the legislative executive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from and independent of each other as the nature of a free government will admit or as is consistent with that chain of connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of unity and amity. `` her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in several respects the senate which is a branch of the legislative department is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments the president who is the head of the executive department is the presiding member also of the senate and besides an equal vote in all cases has a casting vote in case of a tie the executive head is himself eventually elective every year by the legislative department and his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same department several of the officers of state are also appointed by the legislature and the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive department the constitution of massachusetts has observed a sufficient though less pointed caution in expressing this fundamental article of liberty it declares `` that the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers or either of them the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers or either of them the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers or either of them. `` this declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of montesquieu as it has been explained and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the convention it goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers of another department in the very constitution to which it is prefixed a partial mixture of powers has been admitted the executive magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body and the senate which is a part of the legislature is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments the members of the judiciary department again are appointable by the executive department and removable by the same authority on the address of the two legislative branches lastly a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legislative department,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> as the appointment to offices particularly executive offices is in its nature an executive function the compilers of the constitution have in this last point at least violated the rule established by themselves i pass over the constitutions of rhode island and connecticut because they were formed prior to the revolution and even before the principle under examination had become an object of political attention the constitution of new york contains no declaration on this subject but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of improperly blending the different departments it gives nevertheless to the executive magistrate a partial control over the legislative department and what is more gives a like control to the judiciary department and even blends the executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this control in its council of appointment members of the legislative are associated with the executive authority in the appointment of officers both executive and judiciary and its court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal members of the judiciary department,"O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> the constitution of new jersey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the preceding the governor who is the executive magistrate is appointed by the legislature is chancellor and ordinary or surrogate of the state is a member of the supreme court of appeals and president with a casting vote of one of the legislative branches the same legislative branch acts again as executive council of the governor and with him constitutes the court of appeals the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legislative department and removable by one branch of it on the impeachment of the other according to the constitution of pennsylvania the president who is the head of the executive department is annually elected by a vote in which the legislative department predominates in conjunction with an executive council he appoints the members of the judiciary department and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all officers judiciary as well as executive the judges of the supreme court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable by the legislature and the executive power of pardoning in certain cases to be referred to the same department the members of the executive counoil are made ex-officio justices of peace throughout the state in delaware the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the legislative department the speakers of the two legislative branches are vice-presidents in the executive department the executive chief with six others appointed three by each of the legislative branches constitutes the supreme court of appeals he is joined with the legislative department in the appointment of the other judges throughout the states it appears that the members of the legislature may at the same time be justices of the peace in this state the members of one branch of it are ex-officio justices of the peace as are also the members of the executive council the principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the legislative and one branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments all officers may be removed on address of the legislature,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> maryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms declaring that the legislative executive and judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other her constitution notwithstanding makes the executive magistrate appointable by the legislative department and the members of the judiciary by the executive department the language of virginia is still more pointed on this subject her constitution declares `` that the legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either house of assembly. `` yet we find not only this express exception with respect to the members of the irferior courts but that the chief magistrate with his executive council are appointable by the legislature that two members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure of the legislature and that all the principal offices both executive and judiciary are filled by the same department the executive prerogative of pardon also is in one case vested in the legislative department,"O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the constitution of north carolina which declares `` that the legislative executive and supreme judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other '' refers at the same time to the legislative department the appointment not only of the executive chief but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary department in south carolina the constitution makes the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department it gives to the latter also the appointment of the members of the judiciary department including even justices of the peace and sheriffs and the appointment of officers in the executive department down to captains in the army and navy of the state in the constitution of georgia where it is declared `` that the legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other '' we find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised by the same authority even justices of the peace are to be appointed by the legislature in citing these cases in which the legislative executive and judiciary departments have not been kept totally separate and distinct i wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the several state governments i am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify they carry strong marks of the haste and still stronger of the inexperience under which they were framed it is but too obvious that in some instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been violated by too great a mixture and even an actual consolidation of the different powers and that in no instance has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice the separation delineated on paper what i have wished to evince is that the charge brought against the proposed constitution of violating the sacred maxim of free government is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in america this interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing paper,"O O O O O , O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the administration of government in its largest sense comprehends all the operations of the body politic whether legislative executive or judiciary but in its most usual and perhaps its most precise signification it is limited to executive details and falls peculiarly within the province of the executive department the actual conduct of foreign negotiations the preparatory plans of finance the application and disbursement of the public moneys in conformity to the general appropriations of the legislature the arrangement of the army and navy the directions of the operations of war these and other matters of a like nature constitute what seems to be most properly understood by the administration of government the persons therefore to whose immediate management these different matters are committed ought to be considered as the assistants or deputies of the chief magistrate and on this account they ought to derive their offices from his appointment at least from his nomination and ought to be subject to his superintendence this view of the subject will at once suggest to us the intimate connection between the duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration to reverse and undo what has been done by a predecessor is very often considered by a successor as the best proof he can give of his own capacity and desert and in addition to this propensity where the alteration has been the result of public choice the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures and that the less he resembles him the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents these considerations and the influence of personal confidences and attachments would be likely to induce every new president to promote a change of men to fill the subordinate stations and these causes together could not fail to occasion a disgraceful and ruinous mutability in the administration of the government,"O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O , , O ; O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O , , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> with a positive duration of considerable extent i connect the circumstance of re-eligibility the first is necessary to give to the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well and to the community time and leisure to observe the tendency of his measures and thence to form an experimental estimate of their merits the last is necessary to enable the people when they see reason to approve of his conduct to continue him in his station in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues and to secure to the government the advantage of permanency in a wise system of administration,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> nothing appears more plausible at first sight nor more ill-founded upon close inspection than a scheme which in relation to the present point has had some respectable advocates i mean that of continuing the chief magistrate in office for a certain time and then excluding him from it either for a limited period or forever after this exclusion whether temporary or perpetual would have nearly the same effects and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O , O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> one ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior there are few men who would not feel much less zeal in the discharge of a duty when they were conscious that the advantages of the station with which it was connected must be relinquished at a determinate period than when they were permitted to entertain a hope of obtaining by meriting a continuance of them this position will not be disputed so long as it is admitted that the desire of reward is one of the strongest incentives of human conduct or that the best security for the fidelity of mankind is to make their interests coincide with their duty even the love of fame the ruling passion of the noblest minds which would prompt a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit requiring considerable time to mature and perfect them if he could flatter himself with the prospect of being allowed to finish what he had begun would on the contrary deter him from the undertaking when he foresaw that he must quit the scene before he could accomplish the work and must commit that together with his own reputation to hands which might be unequal or unfriendly to the task the most to be expected from the generality of men in such a situation is the negative merit of not doing harm instead of the positive merit of doing good,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O .

O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ."
<bos> another ill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation to sordid views to peculation and in some instances to usurpation an avaricious man who might happen to fill the office looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed would feel a propensity not easy to be resisted by such a man to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted and might not scruple to have recourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory though the same man probably with a different prospect before him might content himself with the regular perquisites of his situation and might even be unwilling to risk the consequences of an abuse of his opportunities his avarice might be a guard upon his avarice add to this that the same man might be vain or ambitious as well as avaricious and if he could expect to prolong his honors by his good conduct he might hesitate to sacrifice his appetite for them to his appetite for gain but with the prospect before him of approaching an inevitable annihilation his avarice would be likely to get the victory over his caution his vanity or his ambition,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , , O O , O . O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O , , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> an ambitious man too when he found himself seated on the summit of his country 's honors when he looked forward to the time at which he must descend from the exalted eminence for ever and reflected that no exertion of merit on his part could save him from the unwelcome reverse such a man in such a situation would be much more violently tempted to embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power at every personal hazard than if he had the probability of answering the same end by doing his duty,"O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> would it promote the peace of the community or the stability of the government to have half a dozen men who had had credit enough to be raised to the seat of the supreme magistracy wandering among the people like discontented ghosts and sighing for a place which they were destined never more to possess,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> a third ill effect of the exclusion would be the depriving the community of the advantage of the experience gained by the chief magistrate in the exercise of his office that experience is the parent of wisdom is an adage the truth of which is recognized by the wisest as well as the simplest of mankind what more desirable or more essential than this quality in the governors of nations where more desirable or more essential than in the first magistrate of a nation can it be wise to put this desirable and essential quality under the ban of the constitution and to declare that the moment it is acquired its possessor shall be compelled to abandon the station in which it was acquired and to which it is adapted this nevertheless is the precise import of all those regulations which exclude men from serving their country by the choice of their fellowcitizens after they have by a course of service fitted themselves for doing it with a greater degree of utility,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O ? , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a fourth ill effect of the exclusion would be the banishing men from stations in which in certain emergencies of the state their presence might be of the greatest moment to the public interest or safety there is no nation which has not at one period or another experienced an absolute necessity of the services of particular men in particular situations perhaps it would not be too strong to say to the preservation of its political existence how unwise therefore must be every such self-denying ordinance as serves to prohibit a nation from making use of its own citizens in the manner best suited to its exigencies and circumstances without supposing the personal essentiality of the man it is evident that a change of the chief magistrate at the breaking out of a war or at any similar crisis for another even of equal merit would at all times be detrimental to the community inasmuch as it would substitute inexperience to experience and would tend to unhinge and set afloat the already settled train of the administration,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ! O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O , O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> a fifth ill effect of the exclusion would be that it would operate as a constitutional interdiction of stability in the administration by necessitating a change of men in the first office of the nation it would necessitate a mutability of measures it is not generally to be expected that men will vary and measures remain uniform the contrary is the usual course of things and we need not be apprehensive that there will be too much stability while there is even the option of changing nor need we desire to prohibit the people from continuing their confidence where they think it may be safely placed and where by constancy on their part they may obviate the fatal inconveniences of fluctuating councils and a variable policy,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> these are some of the disadvantages which would flow from the principle of exclusion they apply most forcibly to the scheme of a perpetual exclusion but when we consider that even a partial exclusion would always render the readmission of the person a remote and precarious object the observations which have been made will apply nearly as fully to one case as to the other,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> what are the advantages promised to counterbalance these disadvantages they are represented to be 1st greater independence in the magistrate 2d greater security to the people unless the exclusion be perpetual there will be no pretense to infer the first advantage but even in that case may he have no object beyond his present station to which he may sacrifice his independence may he have no connections no friends for whom he may sacrifice it may he not be less willing by a firm conduct to make personal enemies when he acts under the impression that a time is fast approaching on the arrival of which he not only may but must be exposed to their resentments upon an equal perhaps upon an inferior footing it is not an easy point to determine whether his independence would be most promoted or impaired by such an arrangement,"O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O : , O O O O ; , O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ? O O O O , O , O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O , O O , O O O , ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> as to the second supposed advantage there is still greater reason to entertain doubts concerning it if the exclusion were to be perpetual a man of irregular ambition of whom alone there could be reason in any case to entertain apprehension would with infinite reluctance yield to the necessity of taking his leave forever of a post in which his passion for power and pre-eminence had acquired the force of habit and if he had been fortunate or adroit enough to conciliate the good-will of the people he might induce them to consider as a very odious and unjustifiable restraint upon themselves a provision which was calculated to debar them of the right of giving a fresh proof of their attachment to a favorite there may be conceived circumstances in which this disgust of the people seconding the thwarted ambition of such a favorite might occasion greater danger to liberty than could ever reasonably be dreaded from the possibility of a perpetuation in office by the voluntary suffrages of the community exercising a constitutional privilege,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O ."
<bos> there is an excess of refinement in the idea of disabling the people to continue in office men who had entitled themselves in their opinion to approbation and confidence the advantages of which are at best speculative and equivocal and are overbalanced by disadvantages far more certain and decisive,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O ; O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ."

<bos> there are appearances to authorize a supposition that the adventurous spirit which distinguishes the commercial character of america has already excited uneasy sensations in several of the maritime powers of europe they seem to be apprehensive of our too great interference in that carrying trade which is the support of their navigation and the foundation of their naval strength those of them which have colonies in america look forward to what this country is capable of becoming with painful solicitude they foresee the dangers that may threaten their american dominions from the neighborhood of states which have all the dispositions and would possess all the means requisite to the creation of a powerful marine impressions of this kind will naturally indicate the policy of fostering divisions among us and of depriving us as far as possible of an active commerce in our own bottoms this would answer the threefold purpose of preventing our interference in their navigation of monopolizing the profits of our trade and of clipping the wings by which we might soar to a dangerous greatness did not prudence forbid the detail it would not be difficult to trace by facts the workings of this policy to the cabinets of ministers,"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> if we continue united we may counteract a policy so unfriendly to our prosperity in a variety of ways by prohibitory regulations extending at the same time throughout the states we may oblige foreign countries to bid against each other for the privileges of our markets this assertion will not appear chimerical to those who are able to appreciate the importance of the markets of three millions of people -- increasing in rapid progression for the most part exclusively addicted to agriculture and likely from local circumstances to remain so -- to any manufacturing nation and the immense difference there would be to the trade and navigation of such a nation between a direct communication in its own ships and an indirect conveyance of its products and returns to and from america in the ships of another country suppose for instance we had a government in america capable of excluding great britain with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce from all our ports what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics would it not enable us to negotiate with the fairest prospect of success for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind in the dominions of that kingdom when these questions have been asked upon other occasions they have received a plausible but not a solid or satisfactory answer it has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of britain because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the dutch who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets but would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the dutch as a compensation for their agency and risk would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations by enhancing the price of british commodities in our markets and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the british commerce,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a mature consideration of the objects suggested by these questions will justify a belief that the real disadvantages to britain from such a state of things conspiring with the pre-possessions of a great part of the nation in favor of the american trade and with the importunities of the west india islands would produce a relaxation in her present system and would let us into the enjoyment of privileges in the markets of those islands elsewhere from which our trade would derive the most substantial benefits such a point gained from the british government and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> a further resource for influencing the conduct of european nations toward us in this respect would arise from the establishment of a federal navy there can be no doubt that the continuance of the union under an efficient government would put it in our power at a period not very distant to create a navy which if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties this would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the west indies a few ships of the line sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended our position is in this respect a most commanding one and if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country in the prosecution of military operations in the west indies it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges a price would be set not only upon our friendship but upon our neutrality by a steady adherence to the union we may hope erelong to become the arbiter of europe in america and to be able to incline the balance of european competitions in this part of the world as our interest may dictate,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but in the reverse of this eligible situation we shall discover that the rivalships of the parts would make them checks upon each other and would frustrate all the tempting advantages which nature has kindly placed within our reach in a state so insignificant our commerce would be a prey to the wanton intermeddlings of all nations at war with each other who having nothing to fear from us would with little scruple or remorse supply their wants by depredations on our property as often as it fell in their way the rights of neutrality will only be respected when they are defended by an adequate power a nation despicable by its weakness forfeits even the privilege of being neutral,"O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> under a vigorous national government the natural strength and resources of the country directed to a common interest would baffle all the combinations of european jealousy to restrain our growth this situation would even take away the motive to such combinations by inducing an impracticability of success an active commerce an extensive navigation and a flourishing marine would then be the offspring of moral and physical necessity we might defy the little arts of the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and unchangeable course of nature,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but in a state of disunion these combinations might exist and might operate with success it would be in the power of the maritime nations availing themselves of our universal impotence to prescribe the conditions of our political existence and as they have a common interest in being our carriers and still more in preventing our becoming theirs they would in all probability combine to embarrass our navigation in such a manner as would in effect destroy it and confine us to a passive commerce we should then be compelled to content ourselves with the first price of our commodities and to see the profits of our trade snatched from us to enrich our enemies and p rsecutors that unequaled spirit of enterprise which signalizes the genius of the american merchants and navigators and which is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth would be stifled and lost and poverty and disgrace would overspread a country which with wisdom might make herself the admiration and envy of the world,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there are rights of great moment to the trade of america which are rights of the union -- i allude to the fisheries to the navigation of the western lakes and to that of the mississippi the dissolution of the confederacy would give room for delicate questions concerning the future existence of these rights which the interest of more powerful partners would hardly fail to solve to our disadvantage the disposition of spain with regard to the mississippi needs no comment france and britain are concerned with us in the fisheries and view them as of the utmost moment to their navigation they of course would hardly remain long indifferent to that decided mastery of which experience has shown us to be possessed in this valuable branch of traffic and by which we are able to undersell those nations in their own markets what more natural than that they should be disposed to exclude from the lists such dangerous competitors,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> this branch of trade ought not to be considered as a partial benefit all the navigating states may in different degrees advantageously participate in it and under circumstances of a greater extension of mercantile capital would not be unlikely to do it as a nursery of seamen it now is or when time shall have more nearly assimilated the principles of navigation in the several states will become a universal resource to the establishment of a navy it must be indispensable,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to this great national object a navy union will contribute in various ways every institution will grow and flourish in proportion to the quantity and extent of the means concentred towards its formation and support a navy of the united states as it would embrace the resources of all is an object far less remote than a navy of any single state or partial confederacy which would only embrace the resources of a single part it happens indeed that different portions of confederated america possess each some peculiar advantage for this essential establishment the more southern states furnish in greater abundance certain kinds of naval stores -- tar pitch and turpentine their wood for the construction of ships is also of a more solid and lasting texture the difference in the duration of the ships of which the navy might be composed if chiefly constructed of southern wood would be of signal importance either in the view of naval strength or of national economy some of the southern and of the middle states yield a greater plenty of iron and of better quality seamen must chiefly be drawn from the northern hive the necessity of naval protection to external or maritime commerce does not require a particular elucidation no more than the conduciveness of that species of commerce to the prosperity of a navy,"O O O O O , O , O O O O O .

<bos> an unrestrained intercourse between the states themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home but for exportation to foreign markets the veins of commerce in every part will be replenished and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part commercial enterprise will have much greater scope from the diversity in the productions of different states when the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop it can call to its aid the staple of another the variety not less than the value of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce it can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctations of markets particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods and unsalable at others but if there be a variety of articles it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation the speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the united states would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen states without union or with partial unions,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> it may perhaps be replied to this that whether the states are united or disunited there would still be an intimate intercourse between them which would answer the same ends this intercourse would be fettered interrupted and narrowed by a multiplicity of causes which in the course of these papers have been amply detailed a unity of commercial as well as political interests can only result from a unity of government,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O , , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> there are other points of view in which this subject might be placed of a striking and animating kind but they would lead us too far into the regions of futurity and would involve topics not proper for a newspaper discussion i shall briefly observe that our situation invites and our interests prompt us to aim at an ascendant in the system of american affairs the world may politically as well as geographically be divided into four parts each having a distinct set of interests unhappily for the other three europe by her arms and by her negotiations by force and by fraud has in different degrees extended her dominion over them all africa asia and america have successively felt her domination the superiority she has long maintained has tempted her to plume herself as the mistress of the world and to consider the rest of mankind as created for her benefit men admired as profound philosophers have in direct terms attributed to her inhabitants a physical superiority and have gravely asserted that all animals and with them the human species degenerate in america -- that even dogs cease to bark after having breathed awhile in our atmosphere.1 facts have too long supported these arrogant pretensions of the europeans it belongs to us to vindicate the honor of the human race and to teach that assuming brother moderation union will enable us to do it disunion will will add another victim to his triumphs let americans disdain to be the instruments of european greatness let the thirteen states bound together in a strict and indissoluble union concur in erecting one great american system superior to the control of all transatlantic force or influence and able to dictate the terms of the connection between the old and the new world,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O .

<bos> to the people of the state of new york,O O O O O O O O O :
<bos> after an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the subsisting federal government you are called upon to deliberate on a new constitution for the united states of america the subject speaks its own importance comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the existence of the union the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting in the world it has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country by their conduct and example to decide the important question whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force if there be any truth in the remark the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made and a wrong election of the part we shall act may in this view deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind this idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good but this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected the plan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests innovates upon too many local institutions not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits and of views passions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every state to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power emolument and consequence of the offices they hold under the state establishments and the perverted ambition of another class of men who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions of their country or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under one government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> it is not however my design to dwell upon observations of this nature i am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion into interested or ambitious views candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions and it can not be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance or may hereafter make its appearance will spring from sources blameless at least if not respectable -- the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears so numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes which serve to give a false bias to the judgment that we upon many occasions see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions of the first magnitude to society this circumstance if duly attended to would furnish a lesson of moderation to those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy and a further reason for caution in this respect might be drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists ambition avarice personal animosity party opposition and many other motives not more laudable than these are apt to operate as well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a question were there not even these inducements to moderation nothing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has at all times characterized political parties for in politics as in religion it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution,"O O O , , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> and yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion a torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose to judge from the conduct of the opposite parties we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the bitterness of their invectives an enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty an over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart will be represented as mere pretense and artifice the stale bait for popularity at the expense of the public good it will be forgotten on the one hand that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust on the other hand it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty that in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment their interest can never be separated and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government history will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people commencing demagogues and ending tyrants,"O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the course of the preceding observations i have had an eye my fellow-citizens to putting you upon your guard against all attempts from whatever quarter to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth you will no doubt at the same time have collected from the general scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new constitution yes my countrymen i own to you that after having given it an attentive consideration i am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it i am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty your dignity and your happiness i affect not reserves which i do not feel i will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when i have decided i frankly acknowledge to you my convictions and i will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded the consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity i shall not however multiply professions on this head my motives must remain in the depository of my own breast my arguments will be open to all and may be judged of by all they shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth,"O O O O O O O , O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i propose in a series of papers to discuss the following interesting particulars,"O O , O O O O , O O O O O :"
<bos> the utility of the union to your political prosperity the insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve that union the necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object the conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government its analogy to your own state constitution and lastly the additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government to liberty and to property,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O ."

<bos> it may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the union a point no doubt deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state and one which it may be imagined has no adversaries but the fact is that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new constitution that the thirteen states are of too great extent for any general system and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.1 this doctrine will in all probability be gradually propagated till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it for nothing can be more evident to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject than the alternative of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismemberment of the union it will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that union the certain evils and the probable dangers to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution this shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O , O O .

<bos> as connected with the subject of revenue we may with propriety consider that of economy the money saved from one object may be usefully applied to another and there will be so much the less to be drawn from the pockets of the people if the states are united under one government there will be but one national civil list to support if they are divided into several confederacies there will be as many different national civil lists to be provided for -- and each of them as to the principal departments coextensive with that which would be necessary for a government of the whole the entire separation of the states into thirteen unconnected sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with danger to have many advocates the ideas of men who speculate upon the dismemberment of the empire seem generally turned toward three confederacies -- one consisting of the four northern another of the four middle and a third of the five southern states there is little probability that there would be a greater number according to this distribution each confederacy would comprise an extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of great britain no well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has been proposed by the convention when the dimensions of a state attain to a certain magnitude it requires the same energy of government and the same forms of administration which are requisite in one of much greater extent this idea admits not of precise demonstration because there is no rule by which we can measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of any given number of individuals but when we consider that the island of britain nearly commensurate with each of the supposed confederacies contains about eight millions of people and when we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the passions of so large a society to the public good we shall see no reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient to perform the same task in a society far more numerous civil power properly organized and exerted is capable of diffusing its force to a very great extent and can in a manner reproduce itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement of subordinate institutions,"O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> the supposition that each confederacy into which the states would be likely to be divided would require a government not less comprehensive than the one proposed will be strengthened by another supposition more probable than that which presents us with three confederacies as the alternative to a general union if we attend carefully to geographical and commercial considerations in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different states we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they will most naturally league themselves under two governments the four eastern states from all the causes that form the links of national sympathy and connection may with certainty be expected to unite new york situated as she is would never be unwise enough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of that confederacy there are other obvious reasons that would facilitate her accession to it new jersey is too small a state to think of being a frontier in opposition to this still more powerful combination nor do there appear to be any obstacles to her admission into it even pennsylvania would have strong inducements to join the northern league an active foreign commerce on the basis of her own navigation is her true policy and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her citizens the more southern states from various circumstances may not think themselves much interested in the encouragement of navigation they may prefer a system which would give unlimited scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers of their commodities pennsylvania may not choose to confound her interests in a connection so adverse to her policy as she must at all events be a frontier she may deem it most consistent with her safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of the southern rather than towards the stronger power of the northern confederacy this would give her the fairest chance to avoid being the flanders of america whatever may be the determination of pennsylvania if the northern confederacy includes new jersey there is no likelihood of more than one confederacy to the south of that state,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen states will be able to support a national government better than one half or one third or any number less than the whole this reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to the proposed plan which is founded on the principle of expense an objection however which when we come to take a nearer view of it will appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> if in addition to the consideration of a plurality of civil lists we take into view the number of persons who must necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between the different confederacies against illicit trade and who in time will infallibly spring up out of the necessities of revenue and if we also take into view the military establishments which it has been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and conflicts of the several nations into which the states would be divided we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not less injurious to the economy than to the tranquillity commerce revenue and liberty of every part,"O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O , , , O O O O ."

<bos> we have seen that an uncontrollable power over the elections to the federal government could not without hazard be committed to the state legislatures let us now see what would be the danger on the other side that is from confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the union itself it is not pretended that this right would ever be used for the exclusion of any state from its share in the representation the interest of all would in this respect at least be the security of all but it is alleged that it might be employed in such a manner as to promote the election of some favorite class of men in exclusion of others by confining the places of election to particular districts and rendering it impracticable to the citizens at large to partake in the choice of all chimerical suppositions this seems to be the most chimerical on the one hand no rational calculation of probabilities would lead us to imagine that the disposition which a conduct so violent and extraordinary would imply could ever find its way into the national councils and on the other it may be concluded with certainty that if so improper a spirit should ever gain admittance into them it would display itself in a form altogether different and far more decisive,"O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O .

<bos> the improbability of the attempt may be satisfactorily inferred from this single reflection that it could never be made without causing an immediate revolt of the great body of the people headed and directed by the state governments it is not difficult to conceive that this characteristic right of freedom may in certain turbulent and factious seasons be violated in respect to a particular class of citizens by a victorious and overbearing majority but that so fundamental a privilege in a country so situated and enlightened should be invaded to the prejudice of the great mass of the people by the deliberate policy of the government without occasioning a popular revolution is altogether inconceivable and incredible,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> in addition to this general reflection there are considerations of a more precise nature which forbid all apprehension on the subject the dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national government and õstill more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches must form a powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of elections there is sufficient diversity in the state of property in the genius manners and habits of the people of the different parts of the union to occasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions in society and though an intimate intercourse under the same government will promote a gradual assimilation in some of these respects yet there are causes as well physical as moral which may in a greater or less degree permanently nourish different propensities and inclinations in this respect but the circumstance which will be likely to have the greatest influence in the matter will be the dissimilar modes of constituting the several component parts of the government the house of representatives being to be elected immediately by the people the senate by the state legislatures the president by electors chosen for that purpose by the people there would be little probability of a common interest to cement these different branches in a predilection for any particular class of electors,"O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> as to the senate it is impossible that any regulation of `` time and manner '' which is all that is proposed to be submitted to the national government in respect to that body can affect the spirit which will direct the choice of its members the collective sense of the state legislatures can never be influenced by extraneous circumstances of that sort a consideration which alone ought to satisfy us that the discrimination apprehended would never be attempted for what inducement could the senate have to concur in a preference in which itself would not be included or to what purpose would it be established in reference to one branch of the legislature if it could not be extended to the other the composition of the one would in this case counteract that of the other and we can never suppose that it would embrace the appointments to the senate unless we can at the same time suppose the voluntary co-operation of the state legislatures if we make the latter supposition it then becomes immaterial where the power in question is placed whether in their hands or in those of the union,"O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> but what is to be the object of this capricious partiality in the national councils is it to be exercised in a discrimination between the different departments of industry or between the different kinds of property or between the different degrees of property will it lean in favor of the landed interest or the moneyed interest or the mercantile interest or the manufacturing interest or to speak in the fashionable language of the adversaries to the constitution will it court the elevation of `` the wealthy and the well-born '' to the exclusion and debasement of all the rest of the society,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O , O O O ? , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O ?"
<bos> if this partiality is to be exerted in favor of those who are concerned in any particular description of industry or property i presume it will readily be admitted that the competition for it will lie between landed men and merchants and i scruple not to affirm that it is infinitely less likely that either of them should gain an ascendant in the national councils than that the one or the other of them should predominate in all the local councils the inference will be that a conduct tending to give an undue preference to either is much less to be dreaded from the former than from the latter,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
<bos> the several states are in various degrees addicted to agriculture and commerce in most if not all of them agriculture is predominant in a few of them however commerce nearly divides its empire and in most of them has a considerable share of influence in proportion as either prevails it will be conveyed into the national representation and for the very reason that this will be an emanation from a greater variety of interests and in much more various proportions than are to be found in any single state it will be much less apt to espouse either of them with a decided partiality than the representation of any single state,"O O O O O O O O O O O O . O , O O O O , O O . O O O O , , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O , O O O O O O O ; O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O ."
<bos> in a country consisting chiefly of the cultivators of land where the rules of an equal representation obtain the landed interest must upon the whole preponderate in the government as long as this interest prevails in most of the state legislatures so long it must maintain a correspondent superiority in the national senate which will generally be a faithful copy of the majorities of those assemblies it can not therefore be presumed that a sacrifice of the landed to the mercantile class will ever be a favorite object of this branch of the federal legislature in applying thus particularly to the senate a general observation suggested by the situation of the country i am governed by the consideration that the credulous votaries of state power can not upon their own principles suspect that the state legislatures would be warped from their duty by any external influence but in reality the same situation must have the same effect in the primative composition at least of the federal house of representatives an improper bias towards the mercantile class is as little to be expected from this quarter as from the other,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in order perhaps to give countenance to the objection at any rate it may be asked is there not danger of an opposite bias in the national government which may dispose it to endeavor to secure a monopoly of the federal administration to the landed class as there is little likelihood that the supposition of such a bias will have any terrors for those who would be immediately injured by it a labored answer to this question will be dispensed with it will be sufficient to remark first that for the reasons elsewhere assigned it is less likely that any decided partiality should prevail in the councils of the union than in those of any of its members secondly that there would be no temptation to violate the constitution in favor of the landed class because that class would in the natural course of things enjoy as great a preponderancy as itself could desire and thirdly that men accustomed to investigate the sources of public prosperity upon a large scale must be too well convinced of the utility of commerce to be inclined to inflict upon it so deep a wound as would result from the entire exclusion of those who would best understand its interest from a share in the management of them the importance of commerce in the view of revenue alone must effectually guard it against the enmity of a body which would be continually importuned in its favor by the urgent calls of public necessity,"O O , , O O O O O O O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> i the rather consult brevity in discussing the probability of a preference founded upon a discrimination between the different kinds of industry and property because as far as i understand the meaning of the objectors they contemplate a discrimination of another kind they appear to have in view as the objects of the preference with which they endeavor to alarm us those whom they designate by the description of `` the wealthy and the well-born '' these it seems are to be exalted to an odious pre-eminence over the rest of their fellow-citizens at one time however their elevation is to be a necessary consequence of the smallness of the representative body at another time it is to be effected by depriving the people at large of the opportunity of exercising their right of suffrage in the choice of that body,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

"<bos> but upon what principle is the discrimination of the places of election to be made in order to answer the purpose of the meditated preference are `` the wealthy and the well-born '' as they are called confined to particular spots in the several states have they by some miraculous instinct or foresight set apart in each of them a common place of residence are they only to be met with in the towns or cities or are they on the contrary scattered over the face of the country as avarice or chance may have happened to cast their own lot or that of their predecessors if the latter is the case as every intelligent man knows it to be,1 is it not evident that the policy of confining the places of election to particular districts would be as subversive of its own aim as it would be exceptionable on every other account the truth is that there is no method of securing to the rich the preference apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may elect or be elected but this forms no part of the power to be conferred upon the national government its authority would be expressly restricted to the regulation of the times the places the manner of elections the qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen as has been remarked upon other occasions are defined and fixed in the constitution and are unalterable by the legislature","O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> let it however be admitted for argument sake that the expedient suggested might be successful and let it at the same time be equally taken for granted that all the scruples which a sense of duty or an apprehension of the danger of the experiment might inspire were overcome in the breasts of the national rulers still i imagine it will hardly be pretended that they could ever hope to carry such an enterprise into execution without the aid of a military force sufficient to subdue the resistance of the great body of the people the improbability of the existence of a force equal to that object has been discussed and demonstrated in different parts of these papers but that the futility of the objection under consideration may appear in the strongest light it shall be conceded for a moment that such a force might exist and the national government shall be supposed to be in the actual possession of it what will be the conclusion with a disposition to invade the essential rights of the community and with the means of gratifying that disposition is it presumable that the persons who were actuated by it would amuse themselves in the ridiculous task of fabricating election laws for securing a preference to a favorite class of men would they not be likely to prefer a conduct better adapted to their own immediate aggrandizement would they not rather boldly resolve to perpetuate themselves in office by one decisive act of usurpation than to trust to precarious expedients which in spite of all the precautions that might accompany them might terminate in the dismission disgrace and ruin of their authors would they not fear that citizens not less tenacious than conscious of their rights would flock from the remote extremes of their respective states to the places of election to voerthrow their tyrants and to substitute men who would be disposed to avenge the violated majesty of the people,"O O , , O , O O , O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> in the course of the foregoing review of the constitution i have taken notice of and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it there however remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places these shall now be discussed but as the subject has been drawn into great length i shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper,"O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O . , , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights among other answers given to this it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the states are in a similar predicament i add that new york is of the number and yet the opposers of the new system in this state who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights to justify their zeal in this matter they allege two things one is that though the constitution of new york has no bill of rights prefixed to it yet it contains in the body of it various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights which in substance amount to the same thing the other is that the constitution adopts in their full extent the common and statute law of great britain by which many other rights not expressed in it are equally secured,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> independent of those which relate to the structure of the government we find the following article 1 section 3 clause 7 `` judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment trial judgment and punishment according to law '' section 9 of the same article clause 2 `` the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it '' clause 3 `` no bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed '' clause 7 `` no title of nobility shall be granted by the united states and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of the congress accept of any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state '' article 3 section 2 clause 3 `` the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed but when not committed within any state the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed '' section 3 of the same article `` treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort no person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act or on confession in open court '' and clause 3 of the same section `` the congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted '',"O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O : O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , , O O O O O ; O O O O , , O O O O O , , , O O O O .

"<bos> it may well be a question whether these are not upon the whole of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this state the establishment of the writ of habeas corpus the prohibition of ex-post-facto laws and of titles of nobility to which we have no corresponding provision in our constitution are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains the creation of crimes after the commission of the fact or in other words the subjecting of men to punishment for things which when they were done were breaches of no law and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny the observations of the judicious blackstone,1 in reference to the latter are well worthy of recital `` to bereave a man of life õsays he å or by violence to confiscate his estate without accusation or trial would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation but confinement of the person by secretly hurrying him to jail where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten is a less public a less striking and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government '' and as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas-corpus act which in one place he calls `` the bulwark of the british constitution `` 2","O O O O O O , O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility this may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government for so long as they are excluded there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> to the second that is to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the constitution i answer that they are expressly made subject `` to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same '' they are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power and of course have no constitutional sanction the only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the revolution this consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself,"O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are in their origin stipulations between kings and their subjects abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince such was magna charta obtained by the barons sword in hand from king john such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes such was the petition of right assented to by charles i. in the beginning of his reign such also was the declaration of right presented by the lords and commons to the prince of orange in 1688 and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the bill of rights it is evident therefore that according to their primitive signification they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people and executed by their immediate representatives and servants here in strictness the people surrender nothing and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations `` we the people of the united states to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america '' here is a better recognition of popular rights than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our state bills of rights and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O O O O .

<bos> but a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a constitution like that under consideration which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns if therefore the loud clamors against the plan of the convention on this score are well founded no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this state but the truth is that both of them contain all which in relation to their objects is reasonably to be desired,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . , , O O O O O O O O , O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O O ."
<bos> i go further and affirm that bills of rights in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would even be dangerous they would contain various exceptions to powers not granted and on this very account would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do why for instance should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed i will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power but it is evident that it would furnish to men disposed to usurp a plausible pretense for claiming that power they might urge with a semblance of reason that the constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government this may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights,"O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O .

<bos> on the subject of the liberty of the press as much as has been said i can not forbear adding a remark or two in the first place i observe that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this state in the next i contend that whatever has been said about it in that of any other state amounts to nothing what signifies a declaration that `` the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved '' what is the liberty of the press who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion i hold it to be impracticable and from this i infer that its security whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it must altogether depend on public opinion and on the general spirit of the people and of the government.3 and here after all as is intimated upon another occasion must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights,"O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O O : O O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O , O , O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O .

<bos> there remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point the truth is after all the declamations we have heard that the constitution is itself in every rational sense and to every useful purpose a bill of rights the several bills of rights in great britain form its constitution and conversely the constitution of each state is its bill of rights and the proposed constitution if adopted will be the bill of rights of the union is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government this is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention comprehending various precautions for the public security which are not to be found in any of the state constitutions is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding which are relative to personal and private concerns this we have seen has also been attended to in a variety of cases in the same plan adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention it may be said that it does not go far enough though it will not be easy to make this appear but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing it certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government and hence it must be apparent that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions entirely foreign from the substance of the thing,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O , O O O O O O , O O O O , O O O , O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O , O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ?

<bos> another objection which has been made and which from the frequency of its repetition it is to be presumed is relied on is of this nature `` it is improper õsay the objectorså to confer such large powers as are proposed upon the national government because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the states to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent of the conduct of the representative body '' this argument if it proves any thing proves that there ought to be no general government whatever for the powers which it seems to be agreed on all hands ought to be vested in the union can not be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control but there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded there is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the imagination what are the sources of information by which the people in montgomery county must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the state legislature of personal observation they can have no benefit this is confined to the citizens on the spot they must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men in whom they confide and how must these men obtain their information evidently from the complexion of public measures from the public prints from correspondences with theirrepresentatives and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations this does not apply to montgomery county only but to all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of government,"O O O O O O , O , O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O : O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O .

<bos> it is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create will be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the state governments the executive and legislative bodies of each state will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter may be relied upon if it were only from the rivalship of power and we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people through that channel will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their state representatives,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> it ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity have the same interest with those who are at a distance and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary and to point out the actors in any pernicious project the public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed constitution the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due to the united states this has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters the newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation the of,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> fspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty in addition to the remarks i have made upon the subject in another place i shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense so it is also an established doctrine of political law that `` states neither lose any of their rights nor are discharged from any of their obligations by a change in the form of their civil government `` 4 the last objection of any consequence which i at present recollect turns upon the article of expense if it were even true that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan,"O O O O O O O .

<bos> the great bulk of the citizens of america are with reason convinced that union is the basis of their political happiness men of sense of all parties now with few exceptions agree that it can not be preserved under the present system nor without radical alterations that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head and that these require a different organization of the federal government a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities in conceding all this the question of expense must be given up for it is impossible with any degree of safety to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand the two branches of the legislature are in the first instance to consist of only sixty-five persons which is the same number of which congress under the existing confederation may be composed it is true that this number is intended to be increased but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country it is evident that a less number would even in the first instance have been unsafe and that a continuance of the present number would in a more advanced stage of population be a very inadequate representation of the people,"O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O .

<bos> whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring one source indicated is the multiplication of offices under the new government let us examine this a little,"O O O O O O O O O ? O O , O O O O O O O O . O O O O O ."
<bos> it is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government are the same which will be required under the new there are now a secretary of war a secretary of foreign affairs a secretary for domestic affairs a board of treasury consisting of three persons a treasurer assistants clerks etc these officers are indispensable under any system and will suffice under the new as well as the old as to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries the proposed constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters where they reside more respectable and their services more useful as to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense it will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of state for national officers in the collection of all duties for instance the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description the states individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose what difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the state or by the united states there is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us the chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the united states i do not add the president because there is now a president of congress whose expenses may not be far if any thing short of those which will be incurred on account of the president of the united states the support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter but upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ? O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O , O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government the first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the president even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him according to general principles concerted with the senate and subject to their final concurrence hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the senate and the house of representatives we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third or perhaps half for the former the extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the senate from this circumstance we may infer that until the house of representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future congress,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O , O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O , O O , O O .

<bos> but there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy the business of the united states has hitherto occupied the state legislatures as well as congress the latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for hence it has happened that the sessions of the state legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the states more than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the united states now the members who compose the legislatures of the several states amount to two thousand and upwards which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number the congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the united states themselves without the intervention of the state legislatures who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular states and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done this difference in the time of the sessions of the state legislatures will be clear gain and will alone form an article of saving which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O . O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O .

<bos> the result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the union,"O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O ; O O O O O O O O O O O O , O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ."
