That model first encodes the source sequence into a fixed-size vector (encoder final states), and then decodes based on that vector. Since the only way information from the source side can flow to the target side is through this fixed-size vector, it presents a bottleneck in the encoder-decoder model: no matter how long the source sentence is, it must always be compressed into this fixed-size vector.\n","\n","An _attention mechanism_ (proposed in [this seminal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)) offers a workaround by providing the decoder a dynamic view of the source-side as the decoding proceeds. Instead of compressing the source sequence into a *fixed-size* vector, we preserve the \"resolution\" and encode the source sequence into a *set of vectors* (usually with the same size as the source sequence) which is sometimes called a *memory bank*. When predicting each word, the decoder \"attends to\" this memory bank and assigns a weight to each vector in the set, and the weighted sum of those vectors will be used to make a prediction.

As usual, the query, keys, and values are represented as vectors. The query process provides a score that specifies how much each key should be attended to. The attention can then be summarized by taking an average of the values weighted by the attention score of the corresponding keys. This _context vector_ can then be used as another input to other processes.\n","\n","More formally, let's suppose we have a query vector $\\mathbf{q}\\in \\mathbb{R}^D$, a set of $S$ key-value pairs $\\{(\\mathbf{k}_i, \\mathbf{v}_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^D \\times \\mathbb{R}^D: i \\in \\{1, 2, \\cdots, S\\} \\}$, where $D$ is the hidden size. What we want to do through the attention mechanism is to use the query to attend to the keys, and summarize those values associated with the \"relevant\" keys into a fixed-size context vector $\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^D$. Note that this is different from directly compressing the key-value pairs into a fixed-size vector, since depending on the query, we might end up with different context vectors.\n","\n","To determine the score for a given query and key, it is standard to use a measure of similarity between the query and key. You've seen such similarity measures before, in labs 1-1 and 1-2. A good choice is simply the normalized dot product between query and key. We'll thus take the attention score for query $\\mathbf{q}$ and key $\\mathbf{k}_i$ to be \n","$$\n","a_i = \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_i)}{Z},\n","$$\n","where $\\cdot$ denotes the dot product (inner product) and $\\exp$ is exponentiation which ensures that all scores are nonnegative, and \n","$$Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\exp(\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_i)$$ \n","is the normalizer to guarantee the scores all sum to one. (There are multiple ways of parameterizing the attention function, but the form we present here is the most popular one.) You might have noticed that the operation above is essentially a softmax over $\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$.\n","\n","The attention scores $\\mathbf{a}$ lie on a *simplex* (meaning $a_i\\ge 0$ and $\\sum_i a_i=1$), which lends it some interpretability: the closer $a_i$ is to 1, the more \"relevant\" a key $k_i$ (and hence its value $v_i$) is to the given query. We will observe this later in the lab: When we are about to predict the target word \"3\", $a_i$ is close to 1 for the source word $x_i=\\text{\"three\"}$.

As in lab 4-4, we use a bidirectional LSTM as the encoder, and a unidirectional LSTM as the decoder, and initialize the decoder state with the encoder final state. However, instead of directly projecting the decoder hidden state to logits, we use it as a query vector and attend to all encoder outputs (used as both keys and values), and then concatanate the resulting context vector with the query vector, and project to logits. In addition, we add the context vector to the word embedding at the next time step, so that the LSTM can be aware of the previous attention results. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/nlp-course/data/raw/master/img/encoder_decoder_attn.png\" alt=\"encoder-decoder-attn illustration\" />\n","\n","In the above illustration, at the first time step, we use $q_1$ to denote the decoder output. Instead of directly projecting that to logits as in lab 4-4, we use $q_1$ as the query vector, and use it to attend to the memory bank (which is the set of encoder outputs) and get the context vector $c_1$. We concatenate $c_1$ with $q_1$, and project the result to the vocabulary size to get logits. At the next step, we first embed $y_1$ into embeddings, and then **add** $c_1$ to it (via componentwise addition) and use the sum as the decoder input. This process continues until an end-of-sequence is produced.\n","\n","You'll need to implement `forward_encoder` and `forward_decoder_incrementally` in the code below. The `forward_encoder` function will return a \"memory bank\" in addition to the final states. The \"memory bank\" is simply the encoder outputs at all time steps, which is the first returned value of `torch.nn.LSTM`.\n","\n","The `forward_decoder_incrementally` function forwards the LSTM cell for a single time step. It takes the initial decoder state, the memory bank, and the input word at the current time step and returns logits for this time step. In addition, it needs to return the context vector and the updated decoder state, which will be used for the next time step. Note that here you need to consider **batch sizes greater than 1**, as this function is used in `forward_decoder`, which is used during training.\n","\n","In summary, the steps in decoding are:\n","\n","1.

Use the decoder output as query, the memory bank as **both keys and values**, and compute the context vector through the attention mechanism.
